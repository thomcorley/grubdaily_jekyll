You&#8217;ll only need 2 tablespoons for the hollandaise but you will have a supply for next time! It&#8217;s also nice in a salad dressing. Next, take 250g <i>butter</i> and melt in a pan over a gentle heat. Separate the milk solids from the clear stuff and set aside. You should have about 200ml of <i>clarified butter</i>. Get a large-ish mixing bowl and whisk 3 <i>egg yolks</i> with 2 tablespoons of your reduced vinegar over a large pan of simmering water (you will also use this for poaching the eggs), taking it off frequently to avoid overheating and cooking the eggs. Keep whisking for about 10 minutes, until it forms ribbons when you life the whisk up. This is called a <i>sabayon</i>. Now take it off the heat and whisk in the clarified butter, one ladle-ful at a time. Finally, add some <i>salt</i> to taste along with some freshly squeezed <i>lemon juice</i>.</span>

Slice 1 <i><a href="http://www.grubdaily.com/2010/01/english-breakfast-muffins.html">English muffin</a></i> in half and put in the toaster just before poaching the egg. Carefully crack the egg into a small shallow dish and slide it gently into the almost-simmering water (do two in one pan if you can). Use a spoon to manipulate any stray bits of white back into place if you dare. Once done, simply arrange on a plate as shown in the photograph above, and don&#8217;t be shy with the hollandaise.

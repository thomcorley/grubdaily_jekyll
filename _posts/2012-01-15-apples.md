  I have an obsession with apples; I will on a daily basis fill my pockets with them so that I have a handy snack to enjoy when I am out and about. I love that amazing balance of sweet and sour that an apple provides. Of course it differs from apple to apple, and there are so many types! It would be a dream to eat all of the different varieties in the world, which is quite a task as there are over 7000! <em>Braeburn </em>was my favourite for a long time, I adored the tart crunchiness that made my mouth zing. I am also appreciative of the worthy <em>Granny Smith</em> although I use them more often for cooking than eating; a good choice to make pie with (although inferior in this respect to the glorious <em>Bramley</em>). At home we have a <em>Discovery</em> apple tree; pinkish red with streaks in the flesh, they are tart and fantastic. Recently I am more inclined towards sweeter apples such as <em>Royal Gala</em>, or sometimes <em>Jazz </em>which I discovered a few weeks ago. I looked up Jazz and it turns out it was cultivated for the first time in 2007 by crossing a <em>Braeburn </em>with a <em>Royal Gala</em>. Magic! Indeed most of the varieties of apples that exist are simply cross-breeds of two different existing ones.

I am planning an apple party, there will be a fantastic spectrum of tasty apple treats. Apple pie (of course), toffee apples and baked apples, apple jelly&#8230;.and it will all be accompanied by plenty of cider (a drink which I am particularly fond of). I will have a think and maybe invent some apple cocktails. Apple sorbet is my next adventure; I got given _Raymond Blanc&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1408816873/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thegrubgrot-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1408816873" target="blank">Kitchen Secrets</a>_ for Christmas and he has a recipe for raspberry sorbet. It looks delicious, and he suggests trying the recipe with other fruits&#8230; i.e. apples! So I thought I&#8217;d give it a try. It is possible to make sorbet without an ice-cream churner, and although the resulting texture won&#8217;t be quite as smooth it is still pretty good.

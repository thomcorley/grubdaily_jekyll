I feel the need to express how much I love cheese. I particularly like blue cheese and their strong in-your-face flavours. I love all rich tasting food, so it may come as no surprise that I like blue cheeses so much. My favourite is St. Agur, which I photographed nicely here on a crusty white baguette. It&#8217;s a strong tasting creamy cow&#8217;s milk cheese from France, the home of so many great cheeses. It has an agreeable soft consistency which makes it easy to spread on a cracker if you so wished, perhaps accompanied by a glass of wine. It also goes really&nbsp;well with tomatoes; little cherry tomatoes are the best, on a cracker with a wedge of the cheese. It&#8217;s also pretty awesome spread on toast.&nbsp;I have to say however,&nbsp;that my favourite way to enjoy St. Agur is simply with a bottle of good Port. All you need is a glass and a knife; slice off chunks of the gorgeous cheese, savour it as it melts away in your mouth, then wash down with a swig of Port. Decadent!

Although I wouldn&#8217;t call myself a cheese connoisseur (I&#8217;m aware that there are hundreds and hundreds of cheeses that I&#8217;m not even aware of the existence of, let alone tasted!) I am a huge fan of cheese and it is a staple part of my diet. At home home our fridge was always packed with cheese; mainly various types of cheddar. Lunchtime always consisted of bread with cheese and ham, cheese and ham and tomato, cheese and tomato, cheese and pickle, cheese and pickle and tomato&#8230; you get the idea. Cheddar is so widespread that it has a bit of a reputation for being mediocre I think, which is a shame because there are some really fantastic tasting mature cheddars around. My favourite mass-produced one is Seriously Strong Cheddar, made by McLelland & Son. It&#8217;s tangy and reliably good. The best cheddars to be found, however, are from local. small scale producers. We serve Isle of Mull cheddar as part of the cheese selection at [Wedgwood](http://www.wedgwoodtherestaurant.co.uk/), which is excellent. The best cheddar I&#8217;ve ever tasted though, was from Green&#8217;s of Glastonbury. It&#8217;s a really mature cheddar, with amazing flavour. It beats Seriously Strong easily. I urge you to try it, you can order it from their website:&nbsp;[www.greensofglastonbury.co.uk](http://www.greensofglastonbury.co.uk/). Go for the &#8220;Traditional Mature Cheddar&#8221;, you won&#8217;t be disappointed.

  A stalwart from the classic French repertoire, à la grenobloise has got to be one of my favourite accompaniments to fish. Raymond Blanc in his excellent <a href="<a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1408816873/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1408816873&linkCode=as2&tag=thegrubgrot-21&quot;>Kitchen Secrets</a><img src=&quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=thegrubgrot-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1408816873&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; />">Kitchen Secrets</a>, does pollack fillet à la grenobloise with pomme purée, &#8220;a dish which is cooked in homes all over France&#8221;. The classic consists of beurre noisette, capers, lemon and parsley, but I like to add some tomato concasse like we did at The Honours for a scallop dish, it adds an extra sweet juiciness and a nice bit of colour.

You could also use coley or hake as a happy substitute. This dish is best served with smooth buttery pomme purée I reckon, as Raymond Blanc&#8217;s recipe, but some boiled new potatoes would be just fine also. Pan-fried fish is such a pleasure for me. The skin is the best bit; fried until golden and crisp, contrasting with perfectly cooked moist flesh underneath. Delicious.

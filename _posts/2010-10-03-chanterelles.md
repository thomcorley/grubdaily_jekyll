<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">It has been over six weeks since I put a new post up here; shocking I know, I apologise. The reason for this is that I moved to Edinburgh to live and get a job as a chef, so I&#8217;ve been busy sorting out the flat in my days off and didn&#8217;t get internet sorted out until recently. My job is at Wedgwood restaurant on the Royal Mile; the cuisine is fantastic and quite fancy so it&#8217;s a great place to learn, which is what I am there for. My life is now centred even more on food, as I am cooking every day at work and then planning things for the Grubdaily Grotto when I&#8217;m at home! Things couldn&#8217;t be better.</span>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I went back home to the farm this weekend for a bit of a gathering with the folks. Lots of food and wine and merriment was had. It also just happened to be the perfect season for my favourite mushrooms: chanterelles! There is a particular spot in the woods, beneath the silver birch trees, where I know I can find them. So we went up to see what we could find, and were not disappointed. There is a deep satisfaction in strolling through the woods foraging for mushrooms, knowing that they&#8217;re going to be turned into something really delicious back in the kitchen. Chanterelles are amazing things. Such an outrageous bright yellow colour, and with their trumpet-shaped curves they seem almost other-worldly. Surely the most photogenic of mushrooms.</span>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">It seems about time I put a risotto recipe up here. You may have noticed that I have a thing for Italian food; I love the ethos behind it: simple and delicious. Risotto was introduced to me a few years ago by my good friend Cecily, and I instantly fell in love with it. I love the mechanics; the constant meticulous stirring, coaxing the starch out of the rice. Since then I have made many many risottos. So here it is on the blog at last. The key to an excellent risotto, I believe, is to have a good stock. So if possible make it from scratch rather than using a stock cube. If you make a roast chicken for dinner, you can use the carcass to make stock and have a fantastic risotto for dinner the next day.</span>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Risotto with Wild Chanterelles (serves 4)</b></span>  
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Get a large, wide-bottomed pan and gently saute 1 large <i>onion</i>, 2 or 3 sticks of <i>celery </i>and 3 cloves of <i>garlic</i> for about 15 minutes until they are nice and soft. Meanwhile, get about 1.5 litres of chicken or vegetable <i>stock</i> simmering in a separate pan, grate 100g of <i>parmesan cheese</i> ready for adding at the end and finely chop 2 large handfuls of <i>flat-leaf parsley</i>. Also, prep your <i>chanterelles</i>: tear or chop so that they&#8217;re all about the same size, leaving the small ones whole. You want about a handful of mushrooms per person.<i>&nbsp;</i>Once your onion base is nice and soft, turn up the heat, add 350g of <i>risotto rice</i> to the pan and stir briefly. Now add a generous glassful of <i>dry white wine</i> and stir until the liquid has been absorbed. Turn the heat back down to a medium flame and add your stock in the same fashion, one-ladle</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;at a time. Constant stirring is required to stop it sticking and to gently massage the starch out to make that lovely thick sauce. When the rice is al dente, add a large knob of <i>butter</i>, most of the <i>chopped parsley</i> and all of the <i>parmesan</i>. Give a good stir, then place a lid on the pan and leave to rest for 3-4 minutes. Meanwhile, cook your chanterelles: melt a small amount of <i>butter </i>in a frying pan, and over a medium heat toss the chanterelles with a pinch of <i>salt </i>and <i>pepper </i>until just tender. Add the rest of the parsley and a small squeeze of <i>lemon juice</i>. Arrange as shown in the photo. Serve with more grated parmesan sprinkled over.</span>

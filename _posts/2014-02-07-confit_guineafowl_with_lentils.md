My confit guinea fowl legs had been sitting happily in the fridge since last week and were just waiting to be turned into something tasty. After the success of the root veg that I served with the breast, I decided to go with something similar…with the addition of lentils. We serve puy lentils like this at work, served with hake which is pan fried with a nice crisp skin. It’s a really versatile garnish though, and works well with chicken, confit duck also. Although the flavour of the confit legs will be best if you leave them to mature in the fat for a week or more, you can do them just a day ahead and still get delicious results. I love lentils prepared like this. The addition of diced vegetables and bacon brings a freshness to the heavy lentils and elevates this dusty store-cupboard ingredient to new heights. And finishing it with freshly chopped garlic and a little white wine vinegar gives a much needed kick. A drizzle of olive oil around, and some crunchy sea salt on the crispy confit skin gives the final touch.

* 2 guineafowl legs
* 200g of puy lentils
* 3 rashers of smoked streaky bacon
* 1 carrot
* 100g of swede
* 100g of celeriac
* 1 sprig of thyme
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 handful of baby spinach
* 1 bunch  of parsley
* 1 clove of garlic
* 1 onion
* sea salt and cracked black pepper
* olive oil
* splash of white wine vinegar
* unsalted butter
* 300g of duck or goose fat
* 300ml of chicken stock

1. Sprinkle the guinea fowl legs in sea salt and cracked black pepper and place in the fridge overnight, or 8 hours. Rinse the salt off, then place in a pot just big enough to fit them in snugly. Add the duck fat, and cook gently for about 1 hour, or until the legs are tender. Transfer to a container, pour the fat over and refrigerate. Leave for at least one week for the flavours to mature, or up to 2 months. The confit will keep for a long time preserved like this.

2. To make the lentils; finely dice the onion and fry gently in olive oil with a pinch of salt until soft. Rinse the lentils under cold water, then add to the pot along with the bay leaf and thyme. Add just enough chicken stock to cover, bring to the boil, then simmer for about 20 minutes until the lentils are tender.

3. Meanwhile, cut the bacon into lardons, and peel and dice the carrot, celeriac and swede into 5mm dice. In a frying pan, cook the lardons in olive oil until crisp, then add the diced vegetables. Turn the heat down, add a pinch of salt and sweat until the veg is tender. Set aside.

4. Heat the oven to 180C. Get the confit legs out of the fat, and scrape off any excess. Fry them in a hot pan skin side down, pressing to flatten slightly, then place in the centre of the oven for about 20 minutes, until the skin is crispy and the meat is heated through.

5. When the lentils are ready, drain off and reserve the stock, then add the vegetables and bacon. Finely chop the garlic and parsley and add to the pot. Add a ladleful of the stock, along with a knob of butter and a drizzle of vinegar. Season to taste with salt.

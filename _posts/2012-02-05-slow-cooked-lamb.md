I often think that I&#8217;m very lucky to have grown up on a sheep farm, as I have a reliable supply of delicious organic lamb to create tasty delights with on a regular basis. I received a delivery of half a lamb a few weeks ago to replenish my supply. All of a sudden the drawers of the freezer were happily jammed and stuffed with shoulder, leg, neck, a heart and countless chops. I wasn&#8217;t likely to go hungry any time soon! If I was forced to choose I would probably have to pick lamb as my favourite meat, which may seem surprising given that throughout my childhood I was nurtured and brought up on it! Far from being sick of it though, I think I have a greater appreciation of good quality meat from well raised animals.

The county of Northumberland (that&#8217;s my home!) produces more lamb than any in Britain, and some of the most delicious lamb and mutton in the world is from there. I hate to see lamb from New Zealand on the supermarket shelves when we have much better tasting stuff right here on our doorstep! The tastiest I&#8217;ve ever had was from the farm back home, and I reckon this meat is the best to be found anywhere.This is from Raymond Blanc&#8217;s Kitchen Secrets, another reliable recipe which his mother, the legendary &#8220;Maman Blanc&#8221; would have made. Rustic home cooking. It&#8217;s lamb shoulder from my farm, slow-roasted to achieve a gorgeous melting texture, and with some bones and neck chops in the bottom of the pan along with wine and herbs creating an extremely flavoursome liquid to make the sauce with. For this I reduced the liquid slightly, thickened with some beurre manie and stirred in some finely chopped mint and a splash of white wine vinegar. Lamb and mint, another classic flavour combination. I served the lamb with some leek and carrot, finely sliced to mirror the flakiness of the meat, and some roasted new potatoes.

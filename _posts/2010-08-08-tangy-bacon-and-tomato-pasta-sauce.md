This was our favourite meal when we were kids; mum was always guaranteed to get empty, licked-clean plates when she served this up! It was consequently the first ever meal that I learnt off by heart; a good starting point to get into cooking as it is so easy. I have modified the original recipe: balsamic vinegar added at the end just before serving makes it tangy and even tastier! I reckon its best served with lots of salad and some garlic bread. A perfect summer meal.

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have always been a fan of pasta. Since dried pasta is so easy to prepare, it&#8217;s not surprising that the first dish many of us learn to cook is a pasta dish. The first recipe I learned by heart was a <a href="http://www.grubdaily.com/2010/08/tangy-bacon-and-tomato-pasta-sauce.html">bacon and tomato sauce</a>. It&#8217;s really easy and really tasty! So, pasta is good. However, when I discovered how easy it is to make your own from simply eggs and flour, my appreciation for it increased dramatically. It takes some time to make, but it&#8217;s really simple and the result is fantastic. It completely knocks the socks off dried pasta.</span>

I&#8217;ve made pasta a few times now, most recently to go with my inviting appearance, I reckoned the tortellini must be filled with something equally special, so obviously my own dry cured bacon was going to play a part in the dish! I fried lardons then added garlic, spinach, crème fraîche and black pepper. It was top notch.</span>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>bacon, spinach and garlic tortellini&nbsp;(serves 4)</b></span>  
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Make your pasta dough: mix 500g of <i>pasta flour</i> with 6 <i>eggs </i>to make a dough. Knead until smooth, silky and elastic &#8211; around 10 minutes. Wrap in cling film and put in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: dice 2-3 rashers of <i>streaky home-cured bacon</i> in <i>olive oil</i> until just starting to turn crisp, then turn the heat right down and add 2 cloves of finely chopped <i>garlic</i>. Cook gently for 10 minutes. Now add a pinch of <i>cracked black pepper</i> along with 2 large handfuls of chopped <i>baby spinach leaves</i> and cook briefly until it has all wilted. Transfer it all to a plate and set aside to cool. When cool enough, put into the fridge. Now for the pasta: roll out the dough very thin, no more than 1mm, then cut into circles of diameter 4-5cm with a pastry cutter or a glass tumbler. Get your spinach filling and stir 1-2 tablespoons of <i>crème fraîche</i> through it, depending on how creamy you want it to be. Lay out all the circles on a lightly floured work surface and place 1/2 a teaspoon of the spinach filling in the centre of each. Fold the tortellini in half around the filling to create a semi-circle, and press down the edges to seal. Now pick it up and wrap it around your index finger, pressing the two corners of the semi-circle together, creating that distinctive navel shape. Magic! Once they&#8217;re all done, boil in plenty of salted water for 3-4 minutes. To serve them, you could make a creamy mushroom sauce which is a common accompaniment. I decided to keep it simple though, and just gently fried a garlic clove in a generous knob of <i>butter</i> and stirred my tortellini through it.</span>

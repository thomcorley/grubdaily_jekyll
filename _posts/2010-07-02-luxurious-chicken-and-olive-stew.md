  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I am writing this after having just eaten this delicious meal; my belly is full, it&#8217;s a warm summer evening and I feel content.&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The combination of green olives, wine and cream in this dish is a bit decadent but absolutely worth it. Such rich flavour. It&#8217;s great served with pasta, as I did today, but is just as good with new potatoes.&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The original version of this recipe came from an old cookbook on Italian cuisine that I picked up in a second hand shop a while ago, and it&#8217;s become one of my favourite ever meals. A nice green salad with a light&nbsp;vinaigrette dressing&nbsp;is the perfect compliment on the side, and a bottle of chilled white wine to accompany is not essential, but definitely recommended!</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>

    <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I was feeling adventurous today and decided to make some fresh tagliatelle instead of the usual dried pasta. The dough was a pleasing rich yellow colour (it turns much lighter upon cooking) and I spent a good twenty minutes kneading it into the desired elastic consistency. It was satisfying and&nbsp;therapeutic. It&#8217;s too time consuming to make fresh pasta every time you make a pasta dish &#8211; after all, Italian cooking is supposed to be quick and simple &#8211; but it&#8217;s definitely worth doing it every once in a while.</span>

    <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First of all, take 5 large <i>chicken thighs</i> (about 600g altogether) and remove their skins and de-bone them. Slice them into strips about 1.5cm thick and set aside. In a large pot, melt a knob of <i>butter</i> and gently sauté 1 large <i>onion</i>, diced, and 3 cloves of <i>garlic</i>, chopped, for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, take 250g of <i>button mushrooms</i> and quarter them, take 1 <i>green pepper</i> and 1 <i>yellow pepper</i> and coarsely chop. Add the peppers and mushrooms to the pot and cook for a few more minutes. Peel and quarter 3 medium <i>tomatoes </i>(about 175g) and add to the pot along with the chicken.&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Add 250ml <i>dry white wine</i> and</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;season with <i>salt</i> and freshly cracked <i>black pepper</i>. Bring to the boil and simmer for a few minutes with the lid off to allow the alcohol to evaporate. Give it a stir, then simmer gently with the lid on for 40 minutes. Add 175g of <i>pitted green olives</i> and cook for a further 10 minutes. Add 6 tablespoons of <i>double cream,</i>&nbsp;and bring back to the boil before adjusting the seasoning, sprinkling over a bunch of chopped <i>flat leaf parsley</i> and serve with generous quantities of grated <i>parmesan cheese</i>.</span>

  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you want the sauce to be a bit thicker, what I do is strain it off into a separate pan, and whisk in small lumps of <i><a href="http://www.grubdaily.com/p/beurre-manie.html">beurre manié</a>,&nbsp;</i>one at a time until the desired consistency is achieved. Make sure you simmer the sauce for a few minutes after adding the last piece of beurre manié to properly cook the flour.</span>

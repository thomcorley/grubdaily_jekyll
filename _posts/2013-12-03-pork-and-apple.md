It&#8217;s apple season once again, and I was lucky to receive a huge box of bramley apples from the garden back home. There are three or four apple trees that surround the house; at this time of year the ground is awash with hundreds of them that have fallen in the wind. I peeled and chopped about thirty of them, tossed in a little lemon juice stewed them with several heaped spoonfuls sugar to make a smooth compote. It&#8217;s got delicious tang like only a bramley can give. I&#8217;m planning to make a few deep dish apple pies with the compote combined with some chunks of a sweet eating variety mixed through, but before I get round to it I wanted to make another classic dish and one of my all time favourites: roast pork and apple sauce.

Bramley apples are perfect to accompany pork belly; the distinctive tang cuts through the rich fattiness of the meat and really makes the dish. I didn&#8217;t serve mine with any potaotes, just a generous heap of shredded sauteed cabbage. It was delicious. This method of cooking pork belly is one of the simplest I know of, and easily my favourite. The slow cooking process and the pressing of the belly afterwards makes for the best crunchy crackling you could imagine, and properly melt-in-the-mouth succulent meat. It&#8217;s really hard to beat.

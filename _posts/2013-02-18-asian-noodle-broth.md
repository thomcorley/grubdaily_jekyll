When we were in Vietnam we fell in love with _p__ho_, the &#8220;noodle soup that build a nation&#8221;;  eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner and sold in hundreds of make-shift street stalls on virtually every corner in Hanoi, the nation&#8217;s bustling capital. We would perch on tiny plastic stools with soup and chopsticks in hand, slurping down the powerful broth while millions of motorbikes provided a symphony of background humming. The most common &#8211; and best &#8211; was _p__ho bo, _rich dark beef stock laden with strips of tender meat and tendons of beef, fragrant spices and light noodles. There was always a basket of bright leaves served alongside, herb-like greens which, when torn in rustic pieces into the bowl gave the perfect balance of freshness to the meaty soup._

This is my own, slightly simpler version of noodle broth. Although it doesn&#8217;t compare to proper Vietnamese _pho_ it&#8217;s a reasonable substitute! To make this recipe you will need to invest some time in making proper beef stock. This takes at least eight hours of gentle simmering and I urge you to do this; the resulting flavour will be far superior than any shop-bought alternative. I haven&#8217;t added any actual meat to the soup as I reckoned there is enough flavour from the stock alone, but feel free to add some strips of cooked beef if you wish.

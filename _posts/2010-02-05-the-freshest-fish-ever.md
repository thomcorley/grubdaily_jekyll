<span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">We went on a fishing trip out in the bay just around from our beach, in the hope of catching some fish for our dinner. There were five of us, so we would need to catch a big one to fill us all up (or lots of little ones). As it happened, we caught a whopper! It was a Rock Fish, and pretty ugly looking, although very tasty according to our Indian fisherman.<br /></span></span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BmWnKiMNzDk/S3BCkpg2c_I/AAAAAAAAAF0/c5kWcq_c5rU/s1600-h/Untitled-1.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5435917947622552562" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: pointer; HEIGHT: 275px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://www.grubdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/image-import/_BmWnKiMNzDk/S3BCkpg2c_I/AAAAAAAAAF0/c5kWcq_c5rU/s400/Untitled-1.jpg" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:+0;"><span style="font-size:+0;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">We took it to a beach side restaurant and they cooked it up for us to have for dinner! It&#8217;s preparation was bare- just a simple marinade and then grilled. Served with chips, it was really good. Less than two hours from sea to plate, easily the freshest fish any of us had eaten. My mouth is watering just thinking about it&#8230;</span></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"></p>

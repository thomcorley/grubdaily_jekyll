  I came home from work today to find Rob, Claire and Amelia sat at the kitchen table making canap&eacute;s! They looked so good that I was compelled to take some photographs of them. Plates of the classic combination Parma ham, tomato, mozzarella and pesto cocktail sticks sat next to the more unusual mini crumpets topped with cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che and smoked salmon. The latter were most unique, and very tasty. With a little squeeze of lemon juice on top they made a lovely little morsel. Claire was inspired to make canapes after seeing &#8220;party forks&#8221; in this month&#8217;s issue of <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/magazine" target="_blank">Jamie Magazine</a>, which she has a subscription to. It&#8217;s a beautifully produced magazine; printed on matt paper, full of sumptuous photographs and very well laid out. As a graphic designer, she finds it irresistible!

I hope you like the photos. If anyone else has any good ideas for canap&eacute;s, I&#8217;d love to know!

Years ago my friend Cecily showed me how to make risotto, she was so enthusiastic about the merits of this dish and was amazed that I&#8217;d never made it before! It was the start of a beautiful relationship; now a staple in my repertoire, I must have made hundreds of risottos, including a few variations&#8230;barley is a nice alternative to rice and perfect to serve with chicken I reckon. We feed barley to the hens on the farm, so this seems like an apt combination for a dish.

A benefit of using barley instead of rice is that it&#8217;s considerably more difficult to overcook. Also the grains give a lovely bursting sensation when you chew them which is quite fantastic. Firstly, I like to caramelise some finely diced pancetta or home-cured bacon to release some vital fat and get an amazing flavour base before adding finely chopped onion to sweat down slowly and gently. I will sweat the onion for a good fifteen minutes before adding anything else, making sure they become soft and sweet. To add some extra flavour and a nice touch of colour, I cooked some carrot dice and some baby button mushrooms in a separate pan to be stirred into the risotto at the very end, along with a generous handful of chopped herbs.

Winter is coming and the time for hearty and warming stews topped with delicious golden crisp pastry is near. Pies! My mouth is watering at just the thought. I already wrote about pies when I did a series of posts on classic home cooking, namely my delicious [steak pie](http://www.grubdaily.com/blog/steak-pie/) and [shepherd&#8217;s pie](http://www.grubdaily.com/blog/shepherds-pie/) but I really felt that chicken pie needed to be added to the collection since this tasty meat is so loved by the masses, including myself!

I was truly thrifty with this dish, wasting nothing, as one always should when eating meat. Here I took one small bird and got maximum use from it, roasting the meat on the bone then using the carcass to make some stock. I then reduced this down to intensify the flavour and enriched it with sherry and a little [beurre manié](http://www.grubdaily.com/beurre-manie/) to make the gravy for the pie. This dish will take most of the day to cook, but I make no apologies for this; I hate to compromise flavour for the sake of saving time. Anyway, there are few things that I enjoy more than spending all afternoon in the kitchen creating something delicious. I served it with some leeks sauteed in butter, it was fantastic.

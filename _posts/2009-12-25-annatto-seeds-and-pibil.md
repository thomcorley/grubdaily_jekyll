  For dinner this Christmas eve I made <i>Puerco Pibil &#8211; </i>a slow-cooked pork dish with an amazingly intense flavour. It&#8217;s flavoured -and coloured- with <i>annatto seeds;</i> they have a distinctive, slightly sharp flavour and a deep red colour, as you can see from the photos. This is an uncompromising meal. When you eat, it rampages down your throat. When I first made it, &#8217;twas was like nothing I had ever tasted before and it remains one of the most unique flavours I have ever encountered. It&#8217;s not just the heat from the chilli, its the combination of that along with the vinegary tang and the distinctive flavour of annatto which makes it. You have to try it.</p>

      You may have heard of this recipe, as it was made famous by the film, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001F3QJBA?ie=UTF8&tag=thegrubgrot-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B001F3QJBA" target="_blank">Once Upon A Time In Mexico</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=thegrubgrot-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B001F3QJBA" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="display:none; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></i>in which Agent Sands (Johnny Depp) eats a <i>Pibil </i>so delicious that he is compelled to go into the kitchen of the restaurant and shoot the chef. It&#8217;s a great film; a real epic &#8211; I recommend you decided to try it out. It was so good that I&#8217;ve made it several times since!

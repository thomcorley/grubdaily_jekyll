I see guinea fowl as a slightly tastier version of chicken. It&#8217;s got a slightly darker flesh and gamier flavour, not unlike pheasant actually, although guinea fowl is not a game bird but has become domesticated like chicken. I&#8217;m a big fan of game birds, and birds in general, chicken included! In fact I tend to eat chicken quite often, as it&#8217;s versatile with many garnishes and also because it&#8217;s so readily available. I went to the shop, picked up a guinea fowl for a change and thought about how to serve it. I reckoned I&#8217;d take it to pieces and make two meals with it; one with the breast and another with the legs. The legs I gently confited in duck fat and left in the fridge to cool in the fat, thus preserving them for a later date. I took the breasts off the bird, then chopped the carcass into pieces to make sauce with. I would make a tasty light _jus_ from the bones and serve it with the roasted breast. I love this way of treating birds; there is no waste, and all the flavour of the animal is used. Also it eliminates the possibility of having to use any artificial stock cubes or suchlike to make the sauce, only pure natural ingredients here!

The star of the show here is the sauce. You could substitute the garnish for anything you want really; mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables&#8230; the root veg mash is really fantastic though, I highly recommend it.

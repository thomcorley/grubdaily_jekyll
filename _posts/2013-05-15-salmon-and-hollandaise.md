This is another classic combination: it&#8217;s also an enduring favourite of mine. I&#8217;m a confessed fanatic of hollandaise sauce so I think this recipe was bound to find it&#8217;s way up here sooner or later! I&#8217;ve told you already about my love of of the best to crisp up, it colours quite easily and also has a delicious layer of fat underneath which melts in your mouth alongside the crunchy skin. The sumptuous oily flesh is offset perfectly by the vinegary tang of the sauce. I like to sit the salmon fillet on a bed of spinach sauteed with a little garlic, it complements the other strong flavours in the dish, and adds a nice bit of colour too.

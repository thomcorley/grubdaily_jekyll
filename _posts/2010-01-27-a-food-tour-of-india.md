I&#8217;m in India on a three month trip with Jack and sister Claire. Apologies there haven&#8217;t been any posts here for a while &#8211; we&#8217;ve been here 2 weeks now and I have been somewhat preoccupied! I do have a recipe on the way though, a tasty curry for you. My aim for this trip is to collect lots of recipes from all over India, and [Online Casino](http://www.mrheromacedonia.com/) put them on this blog. I also plan to post general articles about Indian food, ingredients and cooking. It&#8217;s a bit of a hassle using the internet here as the internet cafes are usually small rooms, very hot and crowded and with frustratingly slow connections! I will do my best&#8230; Come back soon and I will hopefully have the first grubdaily recipe from India online.

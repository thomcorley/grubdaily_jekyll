It&#8217;s been too long since I made soup. Back home on the farm in the winter I used to make soup for lunch almost every day; a big pot of warming goodness accompanied by dad&#8217;s homemade bread with lovely salty butter smeared on it. For me this was the perfect antidote to a winter&#8217;s day, coming in from the cold to feel my body warming from the inside out as I eagerly spooned it down! Mum made the best soups; her two staples were leek and potato, and a chunky tomato soup with carrots and celery added, and white rice to thicken it, a sort of version of minestrone. It&#8217;s fantastic, I&#8217;ll post the recipe up here sometime.

This soup is best in autumn when pumpkins are in season, otherwise winter squash is a good alternative. The sweetness of the pumpkin needs something strong and savoury to balance it, which is where the parmesan comes in. The combination is beautiful. Good home-made chicken stock adds to the savoury notes, and I added cream for richness. Garnishing finally with some chives which gives a hint of acidity as well as a pleasing touch of green. Also, leafing through <a title="How to Cook the Perfect" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/140535934X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thegrubgrot-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=140535934X" target="_blank">Marcus Wareing</a> again, I got the idea of browning the butter before adding the pumpkin, giving a really nice nutty flavour.

When I was younger I always preferred savoury food over sweet, but since working in restaurants and learning to make proper desserts I have come to have a greater appreciation for them. In expanding my culinary repertoire I will embrace all types of food equally, both sweet and savoury! Tarte Tatin is a dessert that we used to do for lunch at Wedgwood; it&#8217;s a classic French dish, delicious and quite easy to make. As with a lot of food I love, I really appreciate the simplicity of it. The combination of rich sweet caramel and tart apples is balanced beautifully by the smoothness from the butter; these are flavours that were made for each other. It&#8217;s the prime season for apples right now so this is a good time to make it!

I&#8217;ve never tried making puff pastry from scratch before, as I know it&#8217;s a time consuming process, but I&#8217;d like to do it some time. I&#8217;ll put a recipe up on here when I do, but for now I&#8217;m just using ready-rolled pastry from the shop which is of pretty good quality anyway and saves a lot of time. Just four ingredients make up this amazing dessert: apples, sugar, butter and puff pastry. As for the apples, a tart eating variety is needed &#8211; I recommend Cox as the best option as they have a great flavour and also hold their shape well when cooked instead of turning mushy. Since it&#8217;s such a simple dish, the quality of each individual ingredient is more important so I would suggest getting a block of some really nice expensive butter for this. Desserts are a luxury anyway so you might as well do it properly!

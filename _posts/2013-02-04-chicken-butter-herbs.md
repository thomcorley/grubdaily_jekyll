As all food lovers will agree, it is a heinous crime to not make stock with the carcass left after your roast chicken dinner. The thing that frustrates me is that this delicious stock can&#8217;t be used for the same meal, it must be saved for another time. I wanted to be able to use all of the chicken, bones and all, in the same way I did with my the meat off the bone. The wings and the remaining carcass were used to make a delicious stock which I reduced down to make a rich intense sauce.

The succulent juicy leg meat was gently reheated with a few spoonfuls of sauce and a generous knob of butter to give a nice glaze. Generous handfuls of chopped fresh herbs, mixed in just enough to barely wilt, were added at the very end. The herbs provide a refreshing aspect to counter the strong flavoured sauce. As far as the garnish goes, mushrooms and leeks are excellent partners to chicken and the leeks add a nice bit of colour to the dish. You can use any vegetable you wish however.

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been working as a chef in Edinburgh for three months now, and have pretty much adjusted to the lifestyle which being a chef entails. Long hours and little sleep is the price for a culinary education in a top restaurant. As I&#8217;ve said before, my life completely revolves around food now so I&#8217;m happy. to know everything about it. Such a large proportion of western-cuisine restaurants are built on the solid foundation of French cooking and so I feel it demands the utmost respect. Saying that, for this blog</span> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I think simple rustic food has more of a place. I love food universally, but I admit I have a penchant for simple dishes where the ingredients really speak for themselves. </span>  
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In considering what photograph would accompany this post, I ended up deciding that an onion would be an appropriate thing to have here: such a humble vegetable, so vital in so many recipes in so many cuisines. So there you have it: my formal appreciation of the onion. </span>  
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thing that I love about food is that there is a virtually endless number of things to learn. For me, every day is a exercise in gathering knowledge and learning as much as possible. My plan is then to regurgitate that knowledge and stick it up on the internet for the world to digest. </span>

  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">      My brother is into making his own mayonnaise. From first trying it and learning the basics of emulsification (the oil much be added <em>gradually!</em>) he is now a mayo expert. Having a weakness for garlic (like myself), he usually includes some in his recipe, so one could argue that it&#8217;s technically not mayonnaise but <em>aioli.</em> Aioli is basically garlic mayonnaise. It&#8217;s a famous classic French sauce from Provence which was traditionally made with olive oil and<em> alot</em> of garlic. The recipe for aioli in can be generously spread on sandwiches as is done with normal mayo. It&#8217;s absolutely fantastic in a bacon sarnie!</span><br /> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /> </span></p>

    <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><strong>Aioli Recipe</strong><br /> <strong>      </strong>Place two egg yolks in a bowl and whisk with 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon of white wine vinegar, 1 finely crushed clove of garlic and a pinch of salt until well blended. Mix together 150ml of extra virgin olive oil and 150ml of sunflower oil in a jug. Start adding the oil to the egg mixture, very slowly in a thin trickle whilst whisking vigorously. If you don&#8217;t do this slowly then the oil will not emulsify with the eggs and it will not thicken. Keep adding the oil gradually until it is all incorporated and you have a thick glossy texture. Thin the aioli if you wish by whisking in some water. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, to taste, and adjust the seasoning if needed.</span>

So, after enjoying our roast partridge so much the obvious thing to do next was make some stock with the leftover carcasses. Guy took on that responsibility, and he had a pot of gently simmering gamey liquid on the stove all afternoon, promising flavour and goodness. I reckoned the most appropriate thing to make with the stock, which incidentally turned out to be delicious, was a nice autumnal broth. However, since we were both working all week with no time off to indulge in soup-making, the stock went into the freezer to wait for its moment to shine.

In the time between my days off we had a new menu launched at work, with recipes and ingredients changed to follow the turning season. As it is the season for game we have pheasant and pigeon on the menu, as well as venison. The pheasants get delivered as whole birds, but we only serve up the leg (confit) and breast (pancetta-wrapped and roasted). The remaining carcass is roasted then turned into stock. This stock was a cut above mine and Guy’s effort, I must admit. Sous chefs Marc and Marcus worked their magic; pheasant and pigeon carcasses and venison bones made up the essential component, and Marcus decided to add extra flavour only in the form of wild foraged mushroom stalks, mainly birch boletus. Game and mushroom stock, it was going to be awesome. Myself and Marcus, a talented chef and fellow food obsessive, were appreciating the fact that the mushroom and game season coincide and that their flavours complement each other so well; it’s as if Mother Nature intended them to go together. And so, the job of turning the excellent game stock into a delicious broth fell to me and was to be served up at lunch. I was delighted to do so, and the broth turned out to be very tasty. There is nothing better to warm you up on a cold, windy October day.

The bar had been set high; mine and Guy’s broth was unlikely to be quite as good as the one I served up at Wedgwood, but would be pretty good nonetheless. The resulting product was much lighter and delicate than the hearty broth we did at Wedgwood, a result of the partridge’s delicate flavour compared to that of pigeon, venison and pheasant. The gamey flavour was still present though, and it went down a treat. Here it is.

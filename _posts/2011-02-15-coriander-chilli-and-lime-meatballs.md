  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This one is a departure from the usual for me. Pork mince that happens to be sitting in my fridge normally gets turned into either allow the mixture to firm up, making it easier to roll into balls.&nbsp;</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make the couscous; put 350g of fine <i>couscous </i>in a bowl and add 450ml of boiling water. Cover and leave for 5 minutes. Fluff up the couscous with a fork, add more water and soak further if need be. Add a generous glug of <i>olive oil</i>, a large bunch of fresh <i>coriander </i>leaves roughly chopped, and the juice of 3 <i>limes</i>. Mix and season to taste with <i>salt</i>.&nbsp;</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pre-heat the oven to 220C/Gas mark 7. Shape your meatballs to about 3cm diameter, then heat a frying pan suitable to go in the oven (ie one with a metal handle, not plastic) and add a splash of <i>vegetable oil</i> (don&#8217;t use olive oil as it burns at too low a temperature). Fry the meatballs over a high flame, constantly turning them until they are uniformly browned, then place them in the oven for about 5 minutes. Serve on a pile of couscous and&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">garnish</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;with some finely sliced <i>chilli</i>.</span>

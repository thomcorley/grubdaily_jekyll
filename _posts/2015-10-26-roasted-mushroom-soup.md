I have long been an advocate of the humble button mushroom. It&#8217;s one of these ingredients that&#8217;s so commonplace, I reckon it&#8217;s not appreciated to its full potential. A staple in your greasy breakfast fry-up, or as a mediocre &#8216;cream of mushroom soup&#8217;, the button mushroom is actually so much better that you might realise. They are high in umami &#8211; the taste that makes things savory &#8211; and they have a lot of powerful flavour locked inside. One of their characteristics is that they have an extremely high water content, making the flavour rather bland until you have reduced the moisture. I&#8217;ve also found that when you fry them in a hot pan with a pinch of salt until they&#8217;re dark and caramelised, the flavour is amazingly intense and savory. This is what gave me the idea of doing a roast mushroom soup. It&#8217;d be better than the average mushroom soup as it would be a rich golden colour, instead of grey, and the resulting flavour would be all the more powerful.

I had the idea of salting the mushrooms after salting aubergines to make my <a href="http://www.grubdaily.com/blog/aubergine-tomato-parmesan/" title="Melanzane salad" target="_blank">Melanzane salad</a>. The act of drawing out the moisture before cooking the mushrooms helps to intensify the flavour and also enables you to get darker caramelisation when roasting. I think you&#8217;ll agree that it&#8217;s pretty special!

Scrambled, fried, poached, soft-boiled… creme anglaise, hollandaise sauce, mayonnaise, pancakes… there are a myriad different uses for them. Imagine life without eggs! It would be a dull existence. I hold eggs in the highest regard and also love to eat them. Out of all the ways to simply prepare them, poached egg is my current favourite, having recently overtaken soft-boiled which held the number-one spot for some time…not to take any credit away from the others however, I still love and respect scrambled, fried and omelette. “What better food is there than an egg which, if kept warm for just three weeks hatches into a living, breathing thing?” was something my grandpa used to say, which I think is a great statement proving that, basically, eggs are awesome.

This is just a simple dish which I made for my lunch the other day. Simple yet delicious. Sautéed potatoes are something we serve up at work, and they’re pretty tasty things. The contrast of colours on this plate are fantastic, just making it seem all the more appetising.

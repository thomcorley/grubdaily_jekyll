Yesterday I made some muffins. Not the American-style cake ones, but the English breakfast variety &#8211; the sort used in making Eggs Benedict. At uni last year, Jack, John and I consumed many muffins in our weekend Eggs Benedict sessions. We first saw this famous breakfast dish on Masterchef, in the round where the contestants have to do a breakfast service in a posh London restaurant. The Eggs Benedict was always a popular choice, and it looked so tasty that we decided to try making some. The star of the dish is the Hollandaise sauce, in all its rich, tangy, buttery glory &#8211; it&#8217;s quite a calorific breakfast, with all the butter and egg yolks in the hollandaise, and then the poached egg and the bacon&#8230; it&#8217;s so tasty though! Anyway, enough about [vigrx premium](http://outletjacka.com/) Eggs Benedict, I will put up a recipe for it along with a photo sometime in the future

We always used to get our muffins from the shop for Eggs Benedict, but I was flicking through _<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0600620425?ie=UTF8&tag=thegrubgrot-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0600620425" target="_blank">Gastronomique</a>_ one day and found a recipe for them, I had some time to kill and decided to try making some. They were great, really soft, doughy and chewy, much better than their shop-bought counterparts. They are best eaten when still warm from cooking. The recipe here is basically the same as in _<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0600620425?ie=UTF8&tag=thegrubgrot-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0600620425" target="_blank">Gastronomique</a>_ but with added butter. The combination of textures is what makes a muffin so enjoyable; the slightly crispy outer layer that you get from cooking them on a griddle or frying pan contrasts beautifully with the soft doughy inside. Scrumptious.

My sister gave me a set of traditional enamel pie tins for my birthday, and as I was planning to do some classic home-made dishes I felt obliged to test them out. The mechanics of making a pie can be so simple; just make a stew, top with pastry or mashed potato and bake. A British institution; shepherd&#8217;s pie, steak and kidney pie, fish pie, cottage pie, pork pie&#8230; all are established classics. Steak and ale pie has always been a favourite of mine, a steaming hearty beef and ale stew topped with buttery puff pastry. Usually a dark, strong flavoured ale would be used for this, but I wanted to try it with Guinness to make it extra dark and extra rich. To balance the bitterness I added sweet carrots, and plenty of them. Onions will also be there to lend sweetness &#8211; how [hgh height growth](http://www.aegisbicycles.com/) could you serve beef without onions?

Out of all the cuts from the &#8216;beast&#8217;, I have a soft spot for beef shin. I first used it when making &#8216;Peposo&#8217;, the classic Italian peasant dish made with red wine, garlic and tons of black pepper. The meat is slowly cooked on the bone, so you end up with a rich meaty jus as you are effectively cooking the meat and making beef stock at the same time. This is basically what I did for my pie &#8211; which should now be called &#8220;Shin of Beef, Carrot and Guinness Pie&#8221;. I got my beef shin from the butcher and asked for large chunks, along with some beef bones which he threw in the bag for free. I slowly braised the meat and bones in Guinness, using the resulting braising liquid to make gravy. It was fantastic.

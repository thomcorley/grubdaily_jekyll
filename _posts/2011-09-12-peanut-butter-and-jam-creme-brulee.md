One of the desserts we serve at Wedgwood is a marmalade on toast creme brulee; it has a layer of marmalade in the bottom of the ramekin and then a toast-infused cream that is set on top. It tastes fantastic. Since I was in &#8216;peanut butter mode&#8217; after making my [shortbread](http://www.grubdaily.com/blog/peanut-butter-millionaire-shortbread/ "Peanut Butter Millionaire Shortbread"), I thought that the same method could work well with peanut butter and jam. This is basically a peanut flavoured custard set into a ramekin on top of some jam. To &#8216;brulee&#8217; a normal creme brulee, sugar is sprinkled on top and then caramelised with a blow torch or by grilling. Tony, one of the Wedgwood chefs, suggested sprinkling on some toasted crushed peanuts at the end to create extra crunch, which I thought was a great idea. Nice one Tony! I decided to use salted peanuts, as the peanut butter contains salt anyway and it gives a nice contrast to the sweet cream and jam.

### Peanut Butter and Jam Creme Brulee Recipe

Heat about 300g of strawberry or redcurrant _jam_ in a saucepan until it melts. Strain through a fine sieve then pour into the bottom of 6 or 7 ramekins, depending on their size. Place in the fridge to set. Crush some salted _peanuts_ into small crumbs and toast in a frying pan until golden. Set aside. Put 200ml of _double cream_, 200ml of _milk_ and 120g of _peanut butter_ into a saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring with a whisk to incorporate the peanut butter. Set aside. Place 5 large _egg yolks_ and 50g of _caster sugar_ in a metal bowl, and whisk over a pan of simmering water until it forms ribbons when lifted up. Pour the peanut butter cream onto the egg mix, continuing to whisk. Heat the mixture on the pan of simmering water, stirring constantly to prevent it sticking. Thicken again until it makes thick ribbons when you lift the whisk up. When your pour the mixture into the ramekins it should be thick enough that it only just levels out. Place in the fridge for several hours to set. When fully chilled, sprinkle a thin layer of sugar over and caramelize with a blow torch. Quickly sprinkle some toasted peanuts over before the sugar has cooled, so they set into the caramel.

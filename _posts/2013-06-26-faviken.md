Since I got this book a few weeks ago I&#8217;ve been so amazed I&#8217;ve hardly been able to put it down. It tells the tale of a restaurant producing food that is perfectly in tune with its surroundings, out of the most pristine fresh ingredients imaginable. The love and respect Magnus Nilsson has for his produce is intense and expressed in his writing; his passion is infectious and it&#8217;s hard not to get excited about this place: Faviken

The restaurant is on a hunting estate in remote central Sweden, where in the long cold winter nothing grows in the ground. The summer months are spent preserving, curing and storing enough food to last through the winter. Nearly all the produce used in the restaurant is from the estate: deer, moose and game birds, wild herbs, mushrooms and flowers, vegetables grown in the Faviken garden, freshwater fish from the lake, and lamb from their own flock of sheep. Whole pigs and cows are bought from nearby farms, which are butchered at the restaurant and cured, aged and matured in every conceivable way. Nothing is wasted. Shellfish and sea fish are sourced from the nearby Norwegian coast. To me it [manufactures ambien](http://peterberley.com/about/) sounds like a utopia, where the ingredients are of immaculate quality and are thus prepared with huge respect. Having grown up on a farm, I share this respect for food in general. It&#8217;d be nice if this was the case in every restaurant, but it&#8217;s impossible in some places that are serving hundreds of people every day. The larger the operation becomes, the more industrial it becomes, and less attention to detail is inevitable. Faviken, however, only serves between 12 and 16 guests every evening and is only open 4 days a week, so there is an immense level of care and attention in the preparation of the food. Everything is done to perfection, as it should be.

For someone like myself who has a great love for food, finding a book like this is such a delight because you have found a like-minded person with the same passion. Nilsson&#8217;s approach to cooking has a reverence and purity to it which I have seldom encountered before, the only other comparison that springs to mind is Thomas Keller. Anyone who has read the French Laundry Cookbook will probably agree. You feel that these people were born to cook.

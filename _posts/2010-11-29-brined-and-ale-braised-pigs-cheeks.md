Pigs and pork has been a popular topic of conversation at work the past week or so, in part due to my adventures making bacon, and the amazing Ibérico ham which Marc and I sampled at a wine-tasting the other week. It’s easily the best ham I’ve ever tasted; it comes as a whole leg with hoof still attached, and a special wooden stand is provided to mount it on, enabling easy slicing. The black Iberian pigs that are reared for this ham are fed on a strict diet of acorns which gives the meat it’s distinctive flavour. The hams are salted and left for two weeks; they’re then rinsed and left to cure for 24-36 months. The result is a cured meat with brilliant texture and flavour. So, it was a happy moment when we found out we could get black Iberian pig’s cheeks from one of our meat suppliers at work.

Marcus had told us of the delicious meal he cooked with pig’s cheeks he bought from Waitrose; they are tasty and very cheap. We ordered in a couple of packs of the special Iberian cheeks. This wasn’t to serve in the restaurant though, this was just for the boys to take home! So… I had six pigs cheeks in my fridge waiting to be turned into something tasty. As I was at work for the rest of the week it was going to be 4 days before I’d get time to cook them so I decided to brine the cheeks to prevent them from going off. I immersed them in brine for 24 hours, then in fresh water overnight to reduce the saltiness. I added garlic, peppercorns and bay to my brine to add some flavour. Then I got out of bed early this morning to get them in the oven. I got the idea of cooking pork with ale from a recipe for belly pork on the channel 4 website (here). I have done that recipe a few times now and it’s really, really tasty. So this pig’s cheeks recipe is pretty similar.

It was freezing cold and snowing all day today so I stayed indoors in the warmth and comfort, with my pig’s cheeks gently cooking in the oven, slowly becoming tender and delicious. The meal was absolutely fantastic. The brining of the meat I believe really helped in making it really tender and moist, I think I shall be brining more often in the future.

My confit guinea fowl legs had been sitting happily in the fridge since last week and were just waiting to be turned into something tasty. After the success of the root veg that I served with the breast, I decided to go with something similar&#8230;with the addition of lentils. We serve puy lentils like this at work, served with hake which is pan fried with a nice crisp skin. It&#8217;s a really versatile garnish though, and works well with chicken, confit duck also. Although the flavour of the confit legs will be best if you leave them to mature in the fat for a week or more, you can do them just a day ahead and still get delicious results.

I love lentils prepared like this. The addition of diced vegetables and bacon brings a freshness to the heavy lentils and elevates this dusty store-cupboard ingredient to new heights. And finishing it with freshly chopped garlic and a little white wine vinegar gives a much needed kick. A drizzle of olive oil around, and some crunchy sea salt on the crispy confit skin gives the final touch.

One of my mum&#8217;s reliable lunchtime soups in the winter is leek and potato; two ingredients that are always in good supply from her veg garden at this time. More of a rustic broth than a soup, with satisfying chunks of leek and roughly diced potato brought together with delicious meat stock, usually the result of lamb or beef bones left over from a roast. Any jelly or roasting juices left from this would be thrown in too, adding to the savouriness.

My mum&#8217;s is an unconventional version of this soup, a way to be thrifty and use up left overs and in the process make something tasty for lunch. This recipe is classic leek and potato soup, adapted from Marcus Wareing&#8217;s excellent book <a title="How to Cook the Perfect..." href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/140535934X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thegrubgrot-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=140535934X" target="_blank">How to Cook the Perfect&#8230;</a> It&#8217;s simple, but he takes care to ensure a gorgeous velvety texture and green colour by using the perfect amount of potato to leek and making sure they don&#8217;t overcook. The trick is to slice the potato really thin so they are cooked at the same time as the leeks.

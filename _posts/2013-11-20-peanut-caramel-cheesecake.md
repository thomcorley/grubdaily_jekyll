The peanut caramel that I made for my [shortbread](http://www.grubdaily.com/blog/peanut-butter-millionaire-shortbread/) a while ago was really good, and it turns out to be great in the form of a cheesecake. When I was on pastry at [Mark Greenaways](http://markgreenaway.com/ "Restaurant Mark Greenaway") we used to do a pre-dessert for the tasting menu that was usually a mini cheesecake served in a whisky glass, with granola sprinkled over as the biscuit component and garnished with a crunchy tuille. I made some peanut caramel for Mark and he loved it (he is also a big fan of peanut butter it turns out!). He suggested making cheesecake with it, and we put it on the menu. He devised a more elaborate form of the cheesecake dessert, with shortbread layers and a frozen cheesecake tuille&#8230;the peanut cheesecake took on a whole new image, and I was proud to have had some input on it! This is my simple version of the cheesecake.

  I am celebrating Scottish produce and classic Scottish ingredients. One of the things that first sprung to mind when I tried thinking of ingredients was beef. Aberdeen Angus beef is widely regarded as the finest in the world and it is native to the counties of Aberdeenshire and Angus in Scotland. A nicely cooked steak from a well aged tender piece of Scottish beef is truly a thing of joy; definitely something worth celebrating! Beef bought from supermarkets can be tough, and this is due to the meat not being hung for long enough, Hanging meat &#8211; especially beef &#8211; is an essential process which makes the meat more tender and flavoursome.

  Because I am in a summery mood even though typically it is actually cold and raining outside, I decided not to do steak but a salad. This one is warm and savoury, with delicious rare nuggets of seared beef being the focal point. Another component of this mouth watering concoction is blue cheese; Dunsyre Blue, another example of excellent Scottish produce, is from Lanarkshire, a county renowned for it&#8217;s cheeses. I have a true fondness for <a href="http://www.grubdaily.com/2010/10/saint-agur.html">blue cheese</a>, and because it&#8217;s well-known as an accompaniment to beef, it seemed an obvious choice here.

       The nuggets of meat will be briefly cooked in a very hot pan, browning the outside creating intense flavour, via the Mailllard <a href="http://www.blackboxrecorder.net/">Pokies</a> reaction, whilst leaving the middle tender and rare. The beef for this recipe must be well selected. As mentioned, iIn order for meat to be flavoursome and tender the animal needs to be hung after slaughter before it is cooked. For beef, this should be around 1 month. Beef sold in supermarkets is rarely hung for this long as it is expensive to do so; between 4-10 days is normal in this instance. In 19th century France, whole beef carcasses were hung for weeks at room temperature until the outside of the meat was literally rotten. This process was known as mortification. Today the meat is hung in specially designed cool rooms. According to Harold McGee beef keeps improving in flavour for up to 1 month (at least 21 days is recommended) if kept at 1-3C and a relative humidity of 70-80%. What actually happens in the meat when it&#8217;s hanging is that the muscle enzymes act upon fat and protein molecules, breaking them down into their component parts and releasing flavourful amino and fatty acids respectively. These enzymes also attack filaments between the muscle fibres, reducing toughness. Well-hung meat is identifiable by it’s darker colour and firmer texture.

  So, when buying beef, go to a good quality butcher and not a supermarket, demanding that the meat has been aged for at least 21 days.

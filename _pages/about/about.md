I am from rural Northumberland, England and grew up on a farm in the Coquet valley. I was raised on good, delicious, no-nonsense homemade grub, mostly made from homegrown vegetables and our own organic lamb. I now work as a chef, working hard and always pushing, trying to find out as much as possible about food!

I am relatively new to the world of chefs and restaurants; before doing this I was at The University of Sheffield studying Physics. I received my BSc degree with honours in June 2009, and after a brief stint traveling in Asia I decided to shun a career in science and pursue what I truly loved: food.

I was always at my happiest spending all day in the kitchen creating something delicious to feed my family, so becoming a chef seemed like the best thing for me to do at this point. When my friends pointed out that I&#8217;d be working very long hours and have little or no social life, I still couldn&#8217;t think of anything I&#8217;d prefer to do. I got a part time job as a commis at Blackmore&#8217;s of Alnwick to get a taste of life as a chef, and I loved it.

In August 2010 I moved to Edinburgh and was lucky enough to get the commis chef job at <a href="http://www.wedgwoodtherestaurant.co.uk/" target="_blank">Wedgwood the Restaurant</a>. Situated right in the centre of town on the Royal Mile, the restaurant was permanently busy. Paul Wedgwood&#8217;s food was great; fine-dining Scottish cuisine, and a lunch menu which changed every day keeping it interesting for us chefs. My learning curve was steep and I progressed rapidly, being promoted to demi chef de partie after just six months.

A little over one year at Wedgwood and I felt the need to move on and learn more from a different kitchen. I spent a month doing stages at all the Michelin starred and best fine-dining restaurants in the city, and eventually ended up at <a href="http://markgreenaway.com/" target="_blank">Restaurant Mark Greenaway</a>. Mark&#8217;s [semenax in india](http://wraprofalafelandgrille.com/semenax-review/) scientific approach to food interested me and he had a beautifully elegant style of presentation which was quite new to me. I was wowed especially by his desserts, which were easily the best I&#8217;d ever seen. As a former head pastry chef, Mark Greenaway obviously knew his stuff when it came to desserts. It was a good opportunity for me to get a good grounding in pastry, so I told him I wanted to work on this section. I spent a couple of months on fish and meat to begin with, then moved over to pastry where I stayed.

Although I enjoyed my time working at Mark Greenaway&#8217;s, there were five restaurants in Edinburgh with a Michelin star which I was really eager to get into as they were held in such high esteem and thought to be the pinnacle of fine cuisine. I  was curious to see how such kitchens were run and how they compared to those I&#8217;d worked in so far; also I felt ready to take my learning to the next level. I landed a job at <a href="http://castleterracerestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Castle Terrace</a>, run by French trained chef Dominic Jack. His CV is formidable:  having only ever worked in restaurants with two or three Michelin stars, including Le Taillivent and L&#8217;Arpege in Paris, he is a chef of the highest calibre, and someone I will learn a vast amount from. I started at Castle Terrace in July 2012 and have been there since. I&#8217;ve never before worked so hard or for longer hours; at times it&#8217;s almost overwhelmingly intense and stressful but the food I&#8217;m learning about is incomparable and it&#8217;s an amazingly valuable experience.

I got into food photography just before my decision to become a chef. I get great satisfaction out of cooking something tasty and then managing to produce a photograph that looks just as delicious. I suppose this website is a means for me to showcase these photos, as well as expressing my passion for food.

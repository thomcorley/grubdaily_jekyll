After seven years of working in some of Scotland's finest restaurants and picking up a wealth of skills and food knowledge along the way, I had reached the point where I was ready to take the next step up and open my own restaurant. After realising that, actually, this wasn't what I wanted after all, I decided to channel my energy into a food website instead. Recipes and photos...grubdaily is as much an outlet for my food photography efforts as for my recipes, I get a huge satisfaction out of chronicling tasty things and sharing them with the world. I hope you enjoy.

I was so pleased with my peanut butter experiments, namely the shortbread and the brulee, that I reckoned there was further potential for peanut flavoured delicacies. &#8220;That tastes great, you could sell it!&#8221; was a comment I got from some who tried my Peanut Caramel, which is similar to the filling I used for the shortbread. I have improved the recipe; it&#8217;s now smoother, more unctuous and caramel-y&#8230; in other words pretty fantastic! So I made a label, poured my caramel into jars and I&#8217;m now selling it.

There are loads of different ways to use Peanut Caramel in sweet dishes. It&#8217;s easily turned into cheesecake, creme anglaise, cake icing, milkshakes&#8230;or peanut caramel shortbread, to but name a few.

Press this mixture into a cake tin (15-20cm diameter) or individual moulds; you want it about 5mm thick. Place in the fridge to chill. Meanwhile, make the cheesecake filling by blending 200g of Peanut Caramel and 200g of cream cheese until completely smooth. Whip 200ml of double cream until soft peaks form, then fold gently into the cheese mixture in three stages. Pour all of the mixture into the cake tin or moulds and leave in the fridge to set.

Gently heat some Peanut Caramel to loosen it, then spread liberally over the shortbread. Place in the fridge to set. Finally, melt some chocolate and spread a thin layer over the top, putting back into the fridge to set.

     Until quite recently it was a well-established fact that there were four distinct flavour receptors on the tongue; sweet, salty, sour and bitter. In 2001 it was proven by scientists at the University of California that there is another distinct taste receptor for monosodium glutamate (MSG), otherwise known as Umami. This is known as the savory taste.

      For thousands for years the Japanese had been using kombu seaweed to make stocks, then in 1908 the chemist Kikunae Ikeda found that the seaweed was especially rich in MSG, and established that is had a unique taste, separate from sweet, salty, sour and bitter. He named it umami which translates roughly as ‘delicious’. One year after this discovery, the company Ajinomoto started artificially synthesizing MSG and selling it as a flavour enhancer in the form of a white, odorless powder. This became widely used in China and Japan, as well as restaurants in western countries.

    MSG has had a bad reputation for being the supposed cause of some maladies associated with the consumption of food from Chinese takeaways, commonly known as ‘The Chinese restaurant syndrome’. This is an unfortunate situation where only a very small number of such cases have occurred but have been blown out of proportion in the media. In fact is has been shown in various studies that MSG is perfectly harmless to all but a handful of people. It is actually present in many natural ingredients besides kombu; tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, shellfish, mushrooms (especially shittake) and [cured meats](http://www.grubdaily.com/2010/11/dry-cure-bacon-part-ii.html) are all high in umami.

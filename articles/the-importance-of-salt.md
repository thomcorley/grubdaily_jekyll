Salt is essential in cooking as a method of drawing out and enhancing the flavour of other ingredients. Without salt, our food would be boring and less tasty. But it is far more important than you might realise. It is essential to us; our bodies do not produce it but need it in order to function. This is why salt tastes so good to us, as the human body has developed an instinctive affinity to it. A precious commodity since ancient times, salt was coveted and revered. It was used in ceremonies and rituals, and the Romans included salt as part of their soldiers’ wages which, interestingly, is the origin of the term ‘salary’.

The most important property of salt however, is that is has the ability to preserve food. For this reason salt was a key factor in the development of civilisation as it allowed communities to survive on a surplus of food throughout the seasons. This is less essential today, but is still used to create artisan cured meats and charcuterie such as Italian Parma ham, chorizo and dry-cured bacon. Salt can be appreciated simply for the love of these delicious meat products, without which they would not be possible.

Salt’s ability to draw water out of food is the mechanism which extracts flavour from other ingredients when we use it in cooking. It is also this mechanism that allows salt to preserve. The fact that food turns bad is due to the water contained within it: food-spoilage bacteria need a water based environment in order to survive. If the food is salted, it becomes dehydrated when the water is drawn out by osmosis, thus inhibiting growth of the harmful bacteria which turn the food rancid. There is also a happy side-effect to this process when the meat is placed in a brine; the salt affects the protein molecules in the meat, changing their shape and allowing them to hold more moisture when cooked, making the meat extra juicy and tender.

All in all, salt is a transcendental, amazing substance which cannot be over-appreciated.

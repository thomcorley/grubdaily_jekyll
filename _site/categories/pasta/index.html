Bolognese sauce in our household was always quite different to what most would consider classic bolognese, which would typically be made with beef and pork. Our sauce would nearly always contain some lamb due to the abundant supply in our freezer. The mince from our own lamb was usually quite fatty and, when mixed in equal parts with lean beef mince, gave a lovely depth of flavour and body to the sauce. It always tasted fantastic; ladled onto a mountain of spaghetti with handfuls of grated parmesan I would devour it with gusto. Lamb bolognese is almost unheard of, which is a shame because it’s so delicious! In my view this is tastier than the classic beef bolognese and I bet that many would agree. Saying that, the recipe I’ve made here is not a plain spag-bol but a modified version, or upgraded, I should say. I made it a little bit creamier than usual, and added extra garlic. A good pile of baby spinach is thrown in and wilted down to tangle with the spaghetti as everything is mixed together. Parmesan cheese is mixed in, along with a splash of the salted starchy pasta water and finally some cherry tomatoes at the very last just to warm through gently. The final sauce is really rich and creamy, with the spinach and tomatoes giving a juiciness that stands up to the strong flavoured lamb.

---
* 500g of lamb mince
* 3 rashers of smoked streaky bacon
* 1 onion
* 1 carrot
* 1 stick of celery
* 3 large cloves of garlic
* 250ml of red wine
* 50g of tomato puree
* 1 litre of lamb stock, or chicken stock
* 1/2 teaspoon of dried chilli flakes
* 50ml of double cream
* 100g of baby spinach leaves
* 100g of parmesan
* 2 sprigs  of thyme
* 400g of dried spaghetti
* olive oil
* sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper

1. Cut the bacon into 5mm dice and in a large, wide-based pan, fry in olive oil until golden and crisp. Finely chop the onion and garlic and add to the pan, turning the heat down. Dice the celery and carrot into 5mm dice and add to the pan. Pick the leaves from the sprigs of thyme and add to the pan along with the chilli flakes. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the lamb mince, red wine, tomato puree and stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 1.5 hours, or until the lamb is tender and the sauce reduced and thick.

2. Cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions. While the pasta is cooking, add the cream and spinach to the bolognese and stir until all the spinach has wilted. Add the parmesan and mix thoroughly to melt the cheese and emulsify it into the sauce. The sauce should now be thick and creamy. Half the cherry tomatoes and have them ready. When the pasta is done, drain in a colander, reserving the starchy liquid. Add the pasta along with the cherry tomatoes into the sauce and mix well. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt or parmesan if needed. Serve immediately

I've just received a slow cooker as a birthday present from my good friend Lewis, its fantastic because it allows me to braise meat and stews for a long time without having to be in the house. When I'm working all day I can have my dinner slowly cooking for when I get back. I make tomato sauce with the slow cooker; tinned tomatoes, onion, garlic, and tomato puree simmered gently for several hours until it is dark and reduced. I then puree and pass it through a fine sieve to make it extra smooth. What you get is an amazingly rich dark red sauce. This can be used for any number of things, but my current favourite is to make salty pungent puttanesca with it. This sauce is accompanied by spaghetti; literally “whore’s style spaghetti”, it’s packed with in-your-face flavours. Traditionally made with tomatoes, garlic, black olives, anchovies and capers, it’s salty and more-ish. It’s a good dish to have in your repertoire; because it’s made almost entirely with store cupboard ingredients it can be rustled up with just a moment’s notice, although in my recipe the tomato sauce is simmered for eight hours to make it extra rich. This isn’t essential but will make your sauce taste amazing. I recommend making a big batch of sauce and freezing it. As there are so many big and bold flavours going on here, I have added a good handful of parsley and basil to bring some freshness to the dish and vital splash of green, making it particularly eye-catching.

---
* 2 400g tins of peeled plum tomatoes
* 3 tablespoons of tomato puree
* 1 onion
* 5 large cloves of garlic
* 1 glass of red wine
* extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tablespoon of sugar
* 1 large handful of pitted black olives
* 6 anchovy fillets
* 1 large bunch of flat leaf parsley
* 1 handful  of basil leaves
* 400g of tagliatelle

1. To make the tomato sauce; finely slice the onion and sweat in a couple of glugs of olive oil with a generous pinch of salt until the onions are completely softened. Now finely chop the garlic cloves and add to the pot along with the tomatoes, tomato puree, sugar and red wine. Bring to the boil, then gently simmer for about 8 hours until the sauce is rich and dark. Puree the sauce in a blender and pass through a fine sieve. it should be fairly thick so that it coats the pasta nicely. If it's too thin, simmer it gently to reduce further. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.

2. Cook your pasta according to the packet instructions while you finish the sauce: finely chop the anchovy fillets and gently fry in a little olive oil until they start to disintegrate, then add the tomato sauce and stir. Slice the olives and add to the sauce. Finely chop the parsley and roughly chop the basil and add to the sauce at the very end. When the pasta is ready, stir the sauce in; add just enough to coat the pasta nicely, it should be really thick. Serve with some red wine and crusy bread. Fantastic!

Macaroni cheese is a classic home-made dish for me. It was a firm favourite for us three at home especially for Rob who would devour mountains of it with lashings of tomato ketchup. We were so particular about the consistency of the sauce, being adamant that it had to be “nice and sloppy”. These days I like it a little thicker but still loose enough to be gooey and tempting, and with a nice golden gratin to give contrast in texture. One thing my parents did was to put slices of tomato on the top among the cheese. As a big fan of tomatoes, I would highly advise this. It gives a light freshness to balance the weight of all that cheese. The quality of a macaroni can be judged by the quality of it’s cheese sauce. My Dad taught me how to make perfectly smooth cheese sauce (or white sauce); he told me to add the milk to the roux in stages, and stir thoroughly each time to ensure that its totally smooth before adding more. It’s completely fail-safe and I’ve never made a lumpy cheese sauce since. Thanks Dad!

---
* 850ml of whole milk
* 3 bay leaves
* 3 cloves of garlic, crushed
* 1 pinch of ground nutmeg
* 5 black peppercorns
* 4 cloves
* 1/2 onion, finely sliced
* 300g of macaroni
* 50g of unsalted butter
* 150g of full flavoured cheese, such as cheddar, or gruyere
* 50ml of double cream
* 2 tablespoons of breadcrumbs
* 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese, finely grated

1. Preheat the oven to 180C. To make the cheese sauce; firstly bring the milk to the boil with the bay leaves, thyme, garlic, nutmeg, peppercorns, cloves and onion. Simmer gently for 20 minutes. Bring a large pan of salted boiling water to the boil and cook 300g of macaroni. Refresh the pasta under cold water once done. Meanwhile make a roux by melting the butter in a saucepan and adding the plain flour. Once combined, strain the flavoured milk and add to the roux in stages.

2. When all the milk is in, add the cheese and double cream. Remove from the heat and stir to combine. Taste and add salt if needed. Mix the pasta and the sauce and pour into a suitably sized baking dish. Now for the gratin; sprinkle the breadcrumbs and finely grated parmesan cheese over the top. Add some slices of tomato, and mozzarella if desired. Place in the oven until lovely and golden on top.

I got the idea for this recipe when I was in India with Jack and Claire. We were in Goa and, growing tired of curry, were craving some western food for our dinner. We came upon an Italian restaurant on the edge of the beach, with plastic tables and chairs arranged under palm trees. Reputedly the pizzas and pasta were particularly good so we thought we’d give it a go. I went for ‘tomato and prawn spaghetti’ and it was absolutely delicious. It was a simple dish, using fresh tomatoes and little baby prawns. It had a really nice light sauce and was the perfect thing to eat on a hot evening, accompanied by a chilled bottle of beer! So this is my attempt at replicating that dish. It’s basically a sauce made from tomato juice, white wine and garlic, then thickened and enriched with butter. The diced tomato flesh and prawns are then simply added to heat through, just before serving. I used frozen cooked baby prawns, but if you can find fresh ones then all the better. It’s seasonal too; tomatoes are just about still good at this time of year, so make the most of it!

---
* 3 tomatoes
* 200g of spaghetti
* 1 clove of garlic
* 30g of unsalted butter
* 180g of cooked prawns
* 1 handful of fresh basil leaves
* sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
* extra virgin olive oil
* 200ml of white wine

1. Get a pan of salted boiling water on the go; this will be for blanching the tomatoes and cooking the spaghetti. To peel the tomatoes: carefully cut out the stalk with the tip of a small knife and score a cross in the bottom. Get a large bowl of very cold water ready, drop the tomatoes in the boiling water for 15 seconds, then remove and place straight into the cold water.

2. Once the water has come back to the boil, add a glug of olive oil, put in the spaghetti and cook according to the packet instructions. Peel the tomatoes, discard the skin then quarter, de-seed (reserving the pulp and seeds) and cut the flesh into small dice. Set aside the dice (this is called tomato concasse).Take the pulp and seeds, blitz in a blender and pass through a fine sieve into a saucepan.

3. Heat another saucepan over a medium heat, and add a glug of olive oil. Add the garlic and saute gently for 30 seconds. and add the wine. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk in the butter cut into small dice piece by piece, being sure to emulsify properly. Add the tomato concasse, prawns and basil. Add the spaghetti and mix everything together, making sure the pasta is nicely coated with the sauce. Taste and season with salt and freshly pepper. Serve and eat immediately!

This has long been a staple dish in my repertoire and I think that I, like many of us, have a weakness for a good meaty pasta sauce. However, bolognese sauce can often turn out mediocre if thrown together in a hurry and without much thought. My philosophy for making a good bolognese rests on two principles. One: it should be really meaty, and two: it should simmer gently for a long time to tenderise the meat. My usual bolognese contains beef mince, pork mince, bacon, and pork sausage meat. This gives a nice combination of meaty flavours. It’s nice to vary things though, and I sometimes combine the beef mince with lamb or venison mince. Another thing about my bolognese, which is slightly controversial, is that I omit tomatoes and only include tomato puree. The main liquid component of the sauce instead comes from beef or pork stock, which promotes a richer meat flavour. This is an easy reliable meal, and a great one to serve if you have guests since just about everyone likes spaghetti bolognese! I usually make a big quantity, then freeze most of it before adding the cream.

---
* 150g of streaky bacon
* 2 onions
* 3 large  cloves of garlic
* 1 stick of celery
* 2 carrots
* 500g of beef mince
* 500g of pork mince
* 250g of good quality sausage meat
* 5 tablespoons of tomato puree
* 200ml of white wine
* 300ml of beef stock
* sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
* 1 sprig of thyme
* 1 bay leaf
* 3 tablespoons of double cream
* vegetable oil, for frying
* parmesan cheese, to serve
* 600g of spaghetti

1. Chop the bacon into small lardons and fry in a couple of tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan. Meanwhile, peel and finely dice onions, garlic and celery. Add to pan with the bacon just as it is starting to colour. Turn the heat down and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes, until the onions are soft and translucent. Peel and chop the carrots into small dice and add to the pan. Cook for a further 5 minutes. Now add the rest of the meat and turn the heat up; stir constantly until all the meat is browned and well mixed. Add the tomato puree, wine and stock, along with a good pinch of cracked black pepper, the thyme and bay leaf. Bring to the boil, then leave barely simmering, uncovered, for about 2 hours, or until the mince is very tender and the sauce is intense and rich. If need be, add more stock if the sauce is looking too dry. Taste, and season. Just before serving, stir in the double cream. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese and a nice big fresh salad.

The best pasta dish on the planet, I reckon, could only be the glorious Carbonara. It exemplifies everything great about Italian cuisine – simple, quick and with an emphasis on quality ingredients. It can be deceptively tricky to perfect however; too much heat when adding the eggs can result in scrambling them instead of gently cooking them to get the desired silky smooth sauce. My favourite way to have this meal is to make the sauce fairly runny, so that a lovely gooey creamy sauce collects at the bottom of your bowl. Each forkfull can then be stirred through this sauce to get it well coated before shoving it in your mouth with gusto, licking your lips and greedily going for another mouthful. This should not be done with any attempt to look dignified – just enjoy it!

---
* 1/2 onion, finely chopped
* 1 to 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
* 80g of streaky bacon, chopped
* olive oil
* salt
* 200g of spaghetti
* 2 free range eggs
* 2 tablespoons of single cream
* 30g of parmesan, finely grated
* 1 generous pinch of freshly cracked  black pepper

1. Put the kettle on to boil for the pasta. Fry the bacon in olive oil in a large frying pan or pot (it will need to be big enough to mix the pasta and the sauce together before serving).

2. Get a pan of boiling water, add plenty of salt and a glug of olive oil and keep it simmering.

3. When the bacon just starts to turn crispy, add the spaghetti to the boiling water.

4. When the bacon is nice and crispy, add the onion and garlic to the pan along with a knob of butter. Turn down the heat and leave to cook gently.

5. Now make your sauce: in a jug, whisk the eggs, cream, parmesan and black pepper. 

6. When the pasta is al dente, drain it, reserving some of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the pan with the bacon and stir briefly (this helps to cool everything down slightly to avoid scrambling the eggs).

7. Now pour in the egg-cream mixture and mix everything together thouroughly. The residual heat from the pasta and bacon will gently cook the eggs and melt the cheese, resulting in an amazingly rich creamy sauce. Add some of the cooking water to achieve a more fluid consistency. Keep stirring until the sauce is silky and smooth, then serve and eat immediately.

This is a really tasty recipe I found online a few weeks ago, and it's perfect for breakfast or brunch. Two of breakfast's long-time favourites, banana and oats, come together here to make a sort of flapjack. Because of the addition of milk and eggs, the texture is more like that of a coarse, oaty cake rather than a flapjack, which I thought was very good. Serve a generous wedge of it with your coffee in the morning for a breakfast of champions!

---
* 180g of coarse oats
* 50g of caster sugar
* 1 teaspoon of baking powder
* 2 teaspoons  of cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon of salt
* 450ml of whole milk
* 3 bananas
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
* 60g of unsalted butter
* 80g of walnuts

1. Heat the oven to 180C. Mix the oats, caster sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a large mixing bowl. Melt the butter in a small pan. In another bowl, mash two of the bananas until almost smooth, then whisk in the milk, egg and vanilla extract. Whisk in the melted butter, then pour over the dry ingredients and mix well. Line a baking tray measuring approx. 20 x 20 cm and pour in the mix. Bake in the oven for about 25 - 30 minutes, until the mixture is firm, with golden colour on top.

2. While the cake is cooking, lay out the walnuts on another baking sheet and bake for about 5 minutes, until browned slightly. When the cake has cooled slightly, slice the remaining banana and arrange on top. Finally garnish with the toasted walnuts.

When I was younger I always preferred savoury food over sweet, but since working in restaurants and learning to make proper desserts I have come to have a greater appreciation for them. In expanding my culinary repertoire I will embrace all types of food equally, both sweet and savoury! Tarte Tatin is a dessert that we used to do for lunch at Wedgwood; it’s a classic French dish, delicious and quite easy to make. As with a lot of food I love, I really appreciate the simplicity of it. The combination of rich sweet caramel and tart apples is balanced beautifully by the smoothness from the butter; these are flavours that were made for each other. It’s the prime season for apples right now so this is a good time to make it! I’ve never tried making puff pastry from scratch before, as I know it’s a time consuming process, but I’d like to do it some time. I’ll put a recipe up on here when I do, but for now I’m just using ready-rolled pastry from the shop which is of pretty good quality anyway and saves a lot of time. Just four ingredients make up this amazing dessert: apples, sugar, butter and puff pastry. As for the apples, a tart eating variety is needed – I recommend Cox as the best option as they have a great flavour and also hold their shape well when cooked instead of turning mushy. Since it’s such a simple dish, the quality of each individual ingredient is more important so I would suggest getting a block of some really nice expensive butter for this. Desserts are a luxury anyway so you might as well do it properly!

---
* 4 cox apples
* 100g of caster sugar
* 30g of unsalted butter, chilled
* 400g of puff pastry

1. Heat the oven to 180C. Put the caster sugar in an even layer into a metal handled frying pan (approx 20cm diameter) and place over a low heat until the sugar has caramelised to a uniform golden brown.

2. While the sugar is heating, peel, core and slice the apples into eighths. Roll out the puff pastry to about 2-3mm thickness and cut a circle about 1/2 an inch wider than the inner diameter of the frying pan.

3. Cut the butter into small dice and set aside. Once the caramel is ready, add the butter in a even layer followed immediately by the apples, rounded sides down. Leave to cook for 2 minutes until the caramel has softened and the butter has melted.

4. Cover carefully with the puff pastry and tuck the edges in. Prick the top several times with a sharp knife to allow steam to escape. Now place in the oven for 15 minutes until the pastry is cooked through, nice and golden.

5. Have a cooling rack ready; remove the tarte from the oven and leave for 1 minute, then quickly turn it out onto the rack upside-down. The caramelised apples should release from the pan nicely. Leave to cool slightly, then eat! Excellent with vanilla ice-cream.

                    <img src="https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/peanut_butter_and_jam_creme_brulee.jpg" />

One of the desserts we serve at Wedgwood is a marmalade on toast creme brulee; it has a layer of marmalade in the bottom of the ramekin and then a toast-infused cream that is set on top. It tastes fantastic. This is basically a peanut flavoured custard set into a ramekin on top of some jam. To ‘brulee’ a normal creme brulee, sugar is sprinkled on top and then caramelised with a blow torch or by grilling. Tony, one of the Wedgwood chefs, suggested sprinkling on some toasted crushed peanuts at the end to create extra crunch, which I thought was a great idea. I decided to use salted peanuts, as the peanut butter contains salt anyway and it gives a nice contrast to the sweet cream and jam.

---
* 300g of strawberry jam
* 1 handful of salted peanuts
* 200ml of double cream
* 200ml of milk
* 120g of peanut butter
* 5 egg yolks
* 50g of caster sugar

1. Heat the strawberry jam until it melts. Strain through a fine sieve then pour into the bottom of 6 or 7 ramekins, depending on their size. Place in the fridge to set. Crush the peanuts into small crumbs and toast in a frying pan until golden. Set aside. Put the cream, milk and peanut butter into a saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring with a whisk to incorporate. Set aside.

2. Place the eggs and caster sugar in a metal bowl, and whisk over a pan of simmering water until it forms ribbons when lifted up. Pour the peanut butter cream onto the egg mix, continuing to whisk. Heat the mixture on the pan of simmering water, stirring constantly to prevent it sticking. Thicken again until it makes thick ribbons when you lift the whisk up. When your pour the mixture into the ramekins it should be thick enough that it only just levels out. Place in the fridge for several hours to set.

3. When fully chilled, sprinkle a thin layer of sugar over and caramelize with a blowtorch. Quickly sprinkle some toasted peanuts over before the sugar has cooled, so they set into the caramel.

My mum makes excellent millionaire shortbread. It’s a treat when she comes to visit because I always get a tin full of lovely caramely chocolatey shortbread squares. On a daily basis I’ll come home from work and, hungry, peruse the fridge for something to eat. The tin of shortbread generally gets raided whilst I’m deciding what to make for my dinner…just one piece usually ends up being two or three; needless to say the millionaire shortbread supply never lasts long! Since peanut butter and chocolate is already established as a good flavour combination it was just a small logical step to make peanut butter millionaire shortbread. I’ve been doing blog posts on Scottish ingredients and recipes, and shortbread is definitely a Scottish thing so I suppose at a stretch this is a Scottish recipe. On flicking through my recipe books, I picked up some tips on how to make shortbread. Although simple, it’s important to make it carefully so as not to end up with a poor result. When mixing the ingredients it’s vital to not overwork as the butter will begin to melt; then when it cooks it’ll be hard instead of the soft, melt-in-the-mouth consistency you’re looking for. Marcus Wareing suggests finely grating the chilled butter when making shortbread, then you hardly have to work the mixture with your hands and the butter barely softens at all. The result is excellent.

---
* 270g of plain flour
* 80g of caster sugar
* 220g of unsalted butter
* 150g of condensed milk
* 50g of golden syrup
* 150g of smooth peanut butter
* 200g of milk chocolate, or dark chocolate

1. First make the shortbread: in a large mixing bowl, place 270g flour, 80g caster sugar, a pinch of salt and 180g of chilled and finely grated unsalted butter. Lightly rub the mixture together with your hands until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Line a 20cm x 30cm baking tray with greaseproof paper and press the shortbread mixture into it. Place in the fridge for about an hour. Preheat the oven to 160C and bake for 40mins or until light golden in colour. Remove from the oven, prick all over with a fork and leave on a rack to cool.

2. When the shortbread is completely cool, make the peanut butter caramel: place 150g condensed milk, 40g unsalted butter, 50g of golden syrup and 150g of smooth peanut butter in a saucepan over a low heat and stir until melted and thoroughly incorporated. Simmer for 5 minutes whilst stirring constantly with a spatula; this thickens the caramel making it set firm when cooled. Pour onto the shortbread and spread evenly. Put in a cool place to set. To finish, melt 200g of milk or dark chocolate and pour over the caramel shortbread once it has cooled. Leave again to cool, then cut into squares.

This is another classic combination: it’s also an enduring favourite of mine. I’m a confessed fanatic of hollandaise sauce so I think this recipe was bound to find it’s way up here sooner or later! I’ve told you already about my love of of the best to crisp up, it colours quite easily and also has a delicious layer of fat underneath which melts in your mouth alongside the crunchy skin. The sumptuous oily flesh is offset perfectly by the vinegary tang of the sauce. I like to sit the salmon fillet on a bed of spinach sauteed with a little garlic, it complements the other strong flavours in the dish, and adds a nice bit of colour too.

---
* 500ml of white wine vinegar
* 5 black peppercorns
* 1 bunch of tarragon stalks
* 2 blades of mace
* 250g of unsalted butter
* 3 egg yolks
* 1 lemon
* 4 salmon fillets, skin on
* 200g of baby spinach leaves
* 1 clove of garlic
* sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
* vegetable oil, for frying
* unsalted butter

1. Firstly, take the salmon fillets out of the fridge and sit them skin side up on a board. Heat the oven to 200C

2. Make the hollandaise: Make some reduced vinegar by boiling the white wine vinegar with the peppercorns, tarragon and mace, and reduce by half. Strain and pour back into the bottle. You’ll only need 1 tablespoon for the hollandaise but you will have a supply for next time! Melt the butter over a gentle heat. Separate the milk solids from the clear stuff and set aside in a warm place. Whisk the yolks in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of your reduced vinegar over a large pan of simmering water until it's very thick, but be careful not to scramble the eggs. Now take it off the heat and gradually whisk in the clarified butter. Finally, add some salt to taste along with some freshly squeezed lemon juice, and more vinegar reduction if needed.

3. Get a pan smoking hot and add about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Season the skin of the salmon generously with salt, then place skin side down in the hot pan, pressing down to set it flat. Turn the heat to low and cook like this until almost half cooked. Place in the oven for about 2 minutes, until it's almost cooked through.

4. Meanwhile saute the spinach and garlic in butter. Now place the salmon back over a high flame and add a knob of butter. Allow the butter to brown slightly, add a squeeze of lemon juice and baste. Place the salmon on the spinach, pour the sauce over and enjoy.

I haven’t got one single post about fish on this blog yet, which is a shame because I’ve been living in Edinburgh for a while now and, being in Scotland and situated right next to the sea, it’s obviously a great place for eating seafood. I admit that I’m a bit of a novice when it comes to fish as I don’t often cook it, although I do love eating it. I recently invested in a copy of the River Cottage Fish Book which has provided a good bit of inspiration. Flicking through it the other day, a photo of salmon tartare grabbed my attention. Since making steak tartare recently and appreciating it’s beautiful simplicity, salmon tartare obviously appealed to me. Steak tartare is a celebration of well-aged, tender beef that is full of flavour. Salmon tartare is much the same: the piece of fish used must be top quality and as fresh as possible. Finding such a piece of fish was not going to be a problem in Edinburgh, and was particularly easy for me asArmstrong’s fishmongers, recognized by many as the best in the city, happens to be just down the road from my flat. “All of this was fresh this morning” he assured me when I told him I needed a piece of salmon as fresh as possible. On slicing it was clearly very fresh, the orange-pink flesh glossy and firm. Tasting it as it was, pure and unadorned, it already had excellent flavour. Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall uses Tabasco and Worcester sauce in his recipe which I chose to omit here as I think the amazing flavour of the fish shouldn’t be masked too much by additives. My version of the dish, I believe, includes enough extra ingredients to compliment and enhance the natural flavour of the fish without overpowering it. One of my favourite things about this dish is the magic worked by the lemon juice. As well as imparting sharp fresh flavour, the acid in the lemon juice affects the protein in the fish, causing a “cooked” texture on the surface of the meat. The acid denatures the protein molecules just as heat does when cooking, and as the brine did in my pig’s cheeks recipe. Pickling things in vinegar, again, has the same denaturing effect. All of these in a sense are just different ways of cooking meat. The advantage of using a method like this is that the fresh flavour of the raw meat does not change nearly as much as if you cooked it. The salmon will continue to “cook” for as long as it is left to marinate in the lemon juice. I would recommend no more than 5 minutes; this will result in a fairly thin layer of cooked-texture meat surrounding a lovely soft rare centre.

---
* 1 teaspoon of shallots, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon of parsley, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon of chives, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon of gherkins, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, freshly squeezed
* sea salt
* freshly cracked black pepper

1. Remove the skin from the salmon and cut out the grey coloured blood line so you have only the shiny pink flesh. Cut into approximate 1cm dice and place in a bowl. Add shallots, parsley, chives, gherkins and lemon juice, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Mix well, taste and adjust the quantities and seasoning if need be. There are no exact quantities for this, just experiment and find out what works best for you. Leave to

A perfect combination of smoked haddock, potatoes, leeks and cream make up this classic Scottish soup. I have written already about my love for smoked haddock, in particular Arbroath Smokies, and this soup is further evidence for why smoked haddock is basically awesome. Some recipes for Cullen Skink will instruct to keep a rustic broth-like consistency, with pieces of potato and haddock giving a nice chunky texture, but I prefer to make a super smooth soup, like a veloute, and then garnish the soup with diced potatoes, flaked smoked haddock and herbs. This gives a nice texture contrast, but also looks fantastic too.

---
* 2 Arbroath Smokies
* 700ml of whole milk
* 2 leeks
* 1 onion
* 3 cloves of garlic
* 2 potatoes, about 300g in total
* 30 g  of unsalted butter
* 1 sprig of thyme
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 bunch of dill
* 30ml of double cream
* 3 spring onions
* olive oil

1. Place the Arbroath smokies, thyme and bay in a large shallow pan and cover with the milk. Bring to the boil, cover and leave to infuse for 30 minutes. In the meantime thinly slice the onion, garlic, and the white part of the leeks. Heat about 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium pan and slowly fry the vegetables for about 20 minutes, until soft. Peel and thinly slice ¾ of the potato and add to the pan. Dice the rest of the potato into 5mm cubes and set aside to be sauteed for the garnish.

2. Remove the smokies from the milk and carefully pick the meat away from the bone, discarding the skin. Set the flaked fish aside. Pass the milk through a sieve into the pan of vegetables. Add the cream, and simmer gently for 10 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked. Pour everything into a blender, add ¾ of the flaked smokies and the butter and blend on full power for 5 minutes, until the soup is very smooth and silky. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

3. Heat  about 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan, and fry the potato dice on a medium heat for 5-10 minutes, or until they are tender and a light golden colour. Drain on some kitchen paper and set aside.

4. Garnish the soup with thinly sliced spring onions, the remainder of the flaked smokies, and the sauteed potato dice.

I have always been a huge fan of garlic. It’s an awesome ingredient that provides a remarkable amount of flavour given its size… it is small but strong! Obviously it’s more potent when raw, and when used for something like pesto or hummus, you need only a tiny bit. After cooking garlic, however, it loses most of it’s kick and becomes much more mellow. So, if you’re making a pasta sauce for example, you might want a decent amount - 3 or 4 cloves perhaps - to sweat with olive oil for the base of the sauce. Roasting garlic increases the mellowing effect even more, and gives it an amazing deep flavour. This is my favourite way to prepare garlic, and it’s perfect for making soup.

---
* 8 bulbs of garlic
* 1 sprig of rosemary
* 300ml of double cream
* 500ml of brown chicken stock
* 1 onion
* sea salt
* cracked black pepper
* 1 bunch of chives
* olive oil
* 1 potato, about 50g

1. Heat the oven to 170C. Add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a roasting tray and get it hot. Reserve 3 cloves for the garnish later, then cut the tops off the bulbs of garlic so the tips of the cloves are poking out, then add to the roasting tray along with the rosemary and roast for about 45 minutes until the garlic is completely soft and oozing out of its skins.

2. Meanwhile finely slice the onion and sweat in a medium pot with olive oil, and a pinch of sea salt. Cook over a medium heat for about 25 minutes until the onion is soft, sweet and slightly caramelised. Peel the potato and finely slice it. Add to the pot and continue to cook, stirring occasionally. Squeeze the garlic out of its skins and add the soft pulp to the pot along with the cream and brown chicken stock. Simmer gently for 20 minutes, then pour everything into a food processor and blend until completely pureed and silky smooth. If it’s a little too thick, add a splash of chicken stock.

3. To garnish the soup, finely slice the 3 reserved garlic cloves with a sharp knife (or a mandolin, if you have one) and saute in a little olive oil until they are lightly coloured. Be careful as they will taste bitter if you let them get too dark. Scatter these over the soup along with some finely chopped chives.

I was clearing out my fridge a few weeks ago and came across a selection of root vegetables lurking there, waiting to be turned into something tasty. The first thing that came to my mind was soup, and since we were in the middle of winter I was thinking along the lines of a chunky, meaty broth. I decided on Chicken, which would provide my soup with both the chunky meat component and the stock. A bunch of fresh coriander which also happened to be in my fridge could be involved here in some way, I thought. I remembered a Madhur Jaffrey recipe for coriander chicken curry, involving large quantities of fresh coriander, resulting in a vibrant green curry sauce. It was fantastic, and so I reckoned it could work in my soup too. The earthiness of all those root vegetables would be balanced by the fresh zing of the coriander, perhaps. I prepared the chicken in my usual way; removed the breasts, then cut up the remaining carcass into small pieces and fried until nicely caramelised for the stock. This time I actually chopped up the wings and legs too and added them to the stock for extra flavour. Once the stock was almost ready, after an hour or so, I took some out to gently poach the breast meat in a separate pan. Once perfectly barely cooked, I allowed them to cool before carefully cutting them into dice. All the vegetables and chicken diced to the same size, making for an attractive looking bowl of broth.

---
* 1 free range chicken
* 1 carrot
* 1 onion
* 1 stick of celery
* 1/2 leek
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1 teaspoon of coriander seeds, crushed
* 5 black peppercorns
* 150ml of dry sherry
* 150ml of red wine
* 75g of unsalted butter
* chicken breasts
* 150g of carrot
* 150g of swede
* 150g of celeriac
* 1 onion
* 2 large cloves of garlic
* 1 large bunch of coriander
* vegetable oil, for frying

1. Remove the breasts from the chicken and set aside. Chop the remaining carcass, including the legs and wings, into small pieces. Cut all the vegetables into approx. 1cm dice, set aside. Get a large heavy based pan on a high heat and colour the bones in 2 batches until golden and caramelised. Add a knob of butter at the end of each batch and foam for a few minutes, to enrich and brown the bones further, then drain the butter off in a colander. Add the vegetables, the garlic, coriander seeds and peppercorns to the same pan, which should have some dark intense residue stuck to the bottom, and sweat gently for about 15- 20 minutes, until soft and sweet. All the tasty chicken residue should have melted into the vegetables. Put the chicken bones back into the pan, and add the sherry and red wine. Reduce the alcohol until completely dry, then cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, skimming any fat and scum that rises. Simmer gently for 2 hours, skimming frequently. Pass through a fine sieve and set aside.

2. When the stock is almost ready, ladle some out into a small pan and gently poach the chicken breasts, just covered with hot stock but not boiling, turning the breasts every few minutes. Remove when they are just barely cooked, and allow to cool. While the stock is cooking, prepare the vegetables for the broth: cut the carrot, celeriac, swede and onion into 5mm dice, and finely chop the garlic. Sweat the onion and garlic in vegetable oil for about 5 minutes, until soft. Add the carrot and cook for about 5 minutes, add the swede and cook for a further 2 minutes, then finally add the celeriac. Sweat until all the veg is nicely cooked, then remove from the heat. Cut the cooked chicken breast into 5mm dice and set aside. When the stock is ready, season to taste with salt and pour just enough over the diced vegetables, ensuring to leave it nice and thick. You may have some leftover. Add the chicken dice and gently warm through. Finally chop the coriander and stir through at the very end.

I have long been an advocate of the humble button mushroom. It’s one of these ingredients that’s so commonplace, I reckon it’s not appreciated to its full potential. A staple in your greasy breakfast fry-up, or as a mediocre ‘cream of mushroom soup’, the button mushroom is actually so much better that you might realise. They are high in umami – the taste that makes things savory – and they have a lot of powerful flavour locked inside. One of their characteristics is that they have an extremely high water content, making the flavour rather bland until you have reduced the moisture. I’ve also found that when you fry them in a hot pan with a pinch of salt until they’re dark and caramelised, the flavour is amazingly intense and savory. This is what gave me the idea of doing a roast mushroom soup. It’d be better than the average mushroom soup as it would be a rich golden colour, instead of grey, and the resulting flavour would be all the more powerful.

---
* 450g of baby button mushrooms
* 1 onion
* 3 cloves of garlic
* 2 rashers  of streaky bacon
* 3 sprigs of rosemary
* 1 1/2litres of chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons of sea salt
* 4 tablespoons of olive oil

1. Set 12 mushrooms aside, and slice the rest of them in half. Sprinkle the halved mushrooms with the sea salt so they're evenly covered, then place in a colander set over a bowl. Leave in the fridge for about 6 hours, or overnight.

2. Heat the oven to 180C, and put a medium sized roasting tray in to heat up. Briefly rinse the mushrooms with cold water, then squeeze them with your hands to remove as much moisture as possible. Pat them dry with kitchen paper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in the roasting tray, then add the mushrooms along with 2 sprigs of rosemary. Roast the mushrooms, tossing occasionally, until they are dark and caramelised.

3. Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion and garlic, and dice the bacon. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium pot and fry the bacon over a high heat until crisp. Turn the heat down and sweat the onion and garlic slowly for about 20 minutes, until soft and sweet. Once the mushrooms are nicely coloured, remove the rosemary from the roasting tray and add the mushrooms to the pan of onions. Add about 1 litre of chicken stock - enough to just cover the mushrooms - and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover with a lid, and simmer for 30 minutes, topping up with chicken stock when it reduces too much.Blend the soup in a food processor on full power for 5 minutes, until you have a silky smooth texture. You may need to add a little more stock to get the required consistency.

4. To finish; slice the 12 reserved mushrooms in half, season with salt and saute them to get a nice roasted colour. Pick the leaves from the remaining rosemary sprig and fry these in olive oil until just crisp. Scatter the mushrooms and rosemary over the soup along with a drizzle of olive oil.

This soup is extremely popular in our household, and one of the first recipes I learned off by heart. Probably closer to minestrone than tomato, It’s thick and hearty, guaranteed to fill you up. Instead of pasta, as in a typical minestrone, this soup has a handful of rice thrown in the beginning which swells up to thicken the liquid and give it some body. You could use lentils instead, if you prefer. This is a chunky, broth-like soup rather than being smooth and silky, and although I like to cut all the vegetables to a nice uniform shape and size, you can cut them any old way and be as rustic as you like. As with many soups, the quality of this one comes down to the stock. I will usually make this soup after cooking a joint of smoked gammon or bacon, using the delicious salty liquid as the meaty backbone for my tomatoey broth. I highly advise this, if not then some nice vegetable stock is an acceptable alternative. This soup is best enjoyed with freshly baked bread and butter. As for us, we were treated to Dad’s crusty baguettes, still piping hot from the oven

---
* 2litres of smoked ham stock, or vegetable stock
* 6 rashers of streaky bacon
* 2 carrots
* 2 onions
* 3 sticks of celery
* 30g of basmati rice
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 1/2 teaspoons of dried thyme
* 1/2 teaspoons of dried oregano
* 2 400g tins of chopped tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons of tomato puree
* sea salt and cracked black pepper
* a  handful of basil or parsley leaves

1. Cut the bacon into lardons and, in a large pot, fry until crispy. Meanwhile, cut the carrot, onion and celery into 5mm dice, and peel and finely chop the garlic. Once the bacon is nice and caramelised, add the onion, garlic and celery. Turn the heat down and sweat gently for 15 minutes, until the onions are soft and dark. Add the basmati rice, carrots, thyme and oregano and fry over a medium heat for 5 minutes. Now add the tomatoes, the tomato puree and the stock. Bring to the boil then simmer gently for 30 minutes. Finish with some torn or chopped basil leaves, then and serve with fresh crusty bread.

When we were in Vietnam we fell in love with pho, the “noodle soup that build a nation”; eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner and sold in hundreds of make-shift street stalls on virtually every corner in Hanoi, the nation’s bustling capital. We would perch on tiny plastic stools with soup and chopsticks in hand, slurping down the powerful broth while millions of motorbikes provided a symphony of background humming. The most common – and best – was pho bo, rich dark beef stock laden with strips of tender meat and tendons of beef, fragrant spices and light noodles. There was always a basket of bright leaves served alongside, herb-like greens which, when torn in rustic pieces into the bowl gave the perfect balance of freshness to the meaty soup. This is my own, slightly simpler version of noodle broth. Although it doesn’t compare to proper Vietnamese pho it’s a reasonable substitute! To make this recipe you will need to invest some time in making proper beef stock. This takes at least eight hours of gentle simmering and I urge you to do this; the resulting flavour will be far superior than any shop-bought alternative. I haven’t added any actual meat to the soup as I reckoned there is enough flavour from the stock alone, but feel free to add some strips of cooked beef if you wish.

---
* 3kg of beef bones
* 2 carrots
* 1 onion
* 1/2 bulb of garlic, cut in two crossways
* 1 sprig of thyme
* 1 bay leaf
* 250ml of red wine
* 1 fresh red chilli, finely sliced
* 20g of root ginger, finely sliced
* 2 celery sticks
* 1 leek, white part only, finely sliced
* 4 spring onions
* 100g of dried egg noodles
* sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
* soy sauce
* toasted sesame oil

1. Firstly make the beef stock: Heat the oven to 200C and roast the bones until dark golden brown. Meanwhile, roughly chop 1 carrot and the onion and, along with the garlic, lightly brown in vegetable oil in a large pan. Add the wine and boil for 3 minutes to remove the alcohol. Add the beef bones, the thyme and bay leaf. Fill with cold water until just covered, then slowly bring to the boil, skimming any scum that rises. Simmer very gently for 8 hours, topping up with more cold water when necessary. Strain off the liquid into a clean pan, and boil until reduced to about 1 litre. For the last 10 minutes add the ginger and chilli. Season carefully with salt, and set aside.

2. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Peel the carrot into ribbons and finely slice. Peel the celery and finely slice. Add all the vegetables except the spring onion to the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes. Lift out with a slotted spoon and rinse under cold water.

3. Cook the noodles in the boiling vegetable water for 4 minutes, then drain. Divide the noodles and vegetables between 4 bowls, then ladle the hot beef stock over the top. Sprinkle the spring onions over the top, and serve.

This is an awesome soup, I adore the combination of rich mutton meatiness and spicy curry. It&#8217;s a proper hearty winter warmer of a dish, and pretty much a meal in itself as it is so thick and substantial. I made this soup with meat from the braised breast and stock that I made from the mutton bones. You could instead use leftover meat from a mutton or lamb roast, along with chicken stock from powder if you don&#8217;t want to make stock from scratch. The mutton could also be substituted quite satisfactorily with chicken; get some chicken thighs, season and toss in olive oil and roast on gas mark 7 for about 30 minutes. Then just pick off the meat and substitute into the recipe below accordingly. I used braised breast, but you could just as well use another cut such as scruffy chops, belly or neck chops. If you do braise some meat, you could use the braising liquor instead of making stock, although it will taste quite strongly of wine (if you use my recipe below) which you may not want in the soup. I believe the rich mellow flavour obtained from the slowly cooked stock is preferable in this case.

---
* 150g of streaky bacon
* 1 onion
* 2 sticks of celery
* 3 large cloves of garlic
* 1/2 teaspoon of mutton fat, reserved from the stock
* 2 carrots, cut into 5mm dice
* 300g of braised mutton, cut into bitesized pieces
* 1 1/2 teaspoon of madras curry powder
* 1/4 teaspoon of paprika
* 1 litre of mutton stock
* sea salt and cracked black pepper
* a few drops of worcester sauce
* 1 teaspoon  of white wine vinegar
* 1 handful of flat leaf parsley
* 300g of potatoes, cut into 1cm dice

1. Cut the bacon into thin lardons and fry in a little olive oil in a large pot until just starting to colour. Dice the onion and celery and finely chop the garlic. Add these to the pot with the bacon, along with the mutton fat. Turn the heat right down and gently sweat the vegetables down for 10-15 minutes until they are nice and soft. Add to the pot the carrots, braised mutton, curry powder, paprika and stock. Taste and season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper, bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to just below simmering point and cook for 15-20 minutes. Add a few drops of Worcester sauce and 1 teaspoon of white wine vinegar. Add the potato dice and cook until the potatoes are tender but not falling apart. Adjust the seasoning and serve with some roughly chopped parsley scattered over.

This curried parsnip soup is the perfect form of resistance against the winter cold; it will warm your aching bones and put a smile on your face, I guarantee it. The chilli gives it a fiery kick which really helps warm you up! The recipe has the unusual addition of coconut - just a hint - which may come as a surprise, but it really transforms the soup and makes it extra delicious.

---
* 300g of parsnips, chopped
* 2 onions, chopped
* 2 or 3 cloves of garlic, chopped
* 50g of butter
* 1 tablespoon of medium strength curry powder
* 1 red chilli, chopped
* 1 1/5litres of vegetable or chicken stock
* 2 (150g) of floury potatoes, chopped
* 1 tablespoon of creamed or dessicated coconut

1. Heat the butter in a saucepan and add the onions and garlic. Cook gently for about 5 minutes without colouring.

2. Add the curry powder and red chilli, along with the stock, and bring to the boil.

3. Add the parsnips, potato and coconut and simmer with the lid on for 20-25 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.

4. Liquidise until smooth with a blender.

5. For garnish: try a swirl of double cream, and a sprinkle of smoked paprika. Or finely chopped red pepper and chives.

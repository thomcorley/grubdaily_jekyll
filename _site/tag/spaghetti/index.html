I got the idea for this recipe when I was in India with Jack and Claire. We were in Goa and, growing tired of curry, were craving some western food for our dinner. We came upon an Italian restaurant on the edge of the beach, with plastic tables and chairs arranged under palm trees. Reputedly the pizzas and pasta were particularly good so we thought we’d give it a go. I went for ‘tomato and prawn spaghetti’ and it was absolutely delicious. It was a simple dish, using fresh tomatoes and little baby prawns. It had a really nice light sauce and was the perfect thing to eat on a hot evening, accompanied by a chilled bottle of beer! So this is my attempt at replicating that dish. It’s basically a sauce made from tomato juice, white wine and garlic, then thickened and enriched with butter. The diced tomato flesh and prawns are then simply added to heat through, just before serving. I used frozen cooked baby prawns, but if you can find fresh ones then all the better. It’s seasonal too; tomatoes are just about still good at this time of year, so make the most of it!

---
* 3 tomatoes
* 200g of spaghetti
* 1 clove of garlic
* 30g of unsalted butter
* 180g of cooked prawns
* 1 handful of fresh basil leaves
* sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
* extra virgin olive oil
* 200ml of white wine

1. Get a pan of salted boiling water on the go; this will be for blanching the tomatoes and cooking the spaghetti. To peel the tomatoes: carefully cut out the stalk with the tip of a small knife and score a cross in the bottom. Get a large bowl of very cold water ready, drop the tomatoes in the boiling water for 15 seconds, then remove and place straight into the cold water.

2. Once the water has come back to the boil, add a glug of olive oil, put in the spaghetti and cook according to the packet instructions. Peel the tomatoes, discard the skin then quarter, de-seed (reserving the pulp and seeds) and cut the flesh into small dice. Set aside the dice (this is called tomato concasse).Take the pulp and seeds, blitz in a blender and pass through a fine sieve into a saucepan.

3. Heat another saucepan over a medium heat, and add a glug of olive oil. Add the garlic and saute gently for 30 seconds. and add the wine. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk in the butter cut into small dice piece by piece, being sure to emulsify properly. Add the tomato concasse, prawns and basil. Add the spaghetti and mix everything together, making sure the pasta is nicely coated with the sauce. Taste and season with salt and freshly pepper. Serve and eat immediately!

This has long been a staple dish in my repertoire and I think that I, like many of us, have a weakness for a good meaty pasta sauce. However, bolognese sauce can often turn out mediocre if thrown together in a hurry and without much thought. My philosophy for making a good bolognese rests on two principles. One: it should be really meaty, and two: it should simmer gently for a long time to tenderise the meat. My usual bolognese contains beef mince, pork mince, bacon, and pork sausage meat. This gives a nice combination of meaty flavours. It’s nice to vary things though, and I sometimes combine the beef mince with lamb or venison mince. Another thing about my bolognese, which is slightly controversial, is that I omit tomatoes and only include tomato puree. The main liquid component of the sauce instead comes from beef or pork stock, which promotes a richer meat flavour. This is an easy reliable meal, and a great one to serve if you have guests since just about everyone likes spaghetti bolognese! I usually make a big quantity, then freeze most of it before adding the cream.

---
* 150g of streaky bacon
* 2 onions
* 3 large  cloves of garlic
* 1 stick of celery
* 2 carrots
* 500g of beef mince
* 500g of pork mince
* 250g of good quality sausage meat
* 5 tablespoons of tomato puree
* 200ml of white wine
* 300ml of beef stock
* sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
* 1 sprig of thyme
* 1 bay leaf
* 3 tablespoons of double cream
* vegetable oil, for frying
* parmesan cheese, to serve
* 600g of spaghetti

1. Chop the bacon into small lardons and fry in a couple of tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan. Meanwhile, peel and finely dice onions, garlic and celery. Add to pan with the bacon just as it is starting to colour. Turn the heat down and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes, until the onions are soft and translucent. Peel and chop the carrots into small dice and add to the pan. Cook for a further 5 minutes. Now add the rest of the meat and turn the heat up; stir constantly until all the meat is browned and well mixed. Add the tomato puree, wine and stock, along with a good pinch of cracked black pepper, the thyme and bay leaf. Bring to the boil, then leave barely simmering, uncovered, for about 2 hours, or until the mince is very tender and the sauce is intense and rich. If need be, add more stock if the sauce is looking too dry. Taste, and season. Just before serving, stir in the double cream. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese and a nice big fresh salad.

The best pasta dish on the planet, I reckon, could only be the glorious Carbonara. It exemplifies everything great about Italian cuisine – simple, quick and with an emphasis on quality ingredients. It can be deceptively tricky to perfect however; too much heat when adding the eggs can result in scrambling them instead of gently cooking them to get the desired silky smooth sauce. My favourite way to have this meal is to make the sauce fairly runny, so that a lovely gooey creamy sauce collects at the bottom of your bowl. Each forkfull can then be stirred through this sauce to get it well coated before shoving it in your mouth with gusto, licking your lips and greedily going for another mouthful. This should not be done with any attempt to look dignified – just enjoy it!

---
* 1/2 onion, finely chopped
* 1 to 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
* 80g of streaky bacon, chopped
* olive oil
* salt
* 200g of spaghetti
* 2 free range eggs
* 2 tablespoons of single cream
* 30g of parmesan, finely grated
* 1 generous pinch of freshly cracked  black pepper

1. Put the kettle on to boil for the pasta. Fry the bacon in olive oil in a large frying pan or pot (it will need to be big enough to mix the pasta and the sauce together before serving).

2. Get a pan of boiling water, add plenty of salt and a glug of olive oil and keep it simmering.

3. When the bacon just starts to turn crispy, add the spaghetti to the boiling water.

4. When the bacon is nice and crispy, add the onion and garlic to the pan along with a knob of butter. Turn down the heat and leave to cook gently.

5. Now make your sauce: in a jug, whisk the eggs, cream, parmesan and black pepper. 

6. When the pasta is al dente, drain it, reserving some of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the pan with the bacon and stir briefly (this helps to cool everything down slightly to avoid scrambling the eggs).

7. Now pour in the egg-cream mixture and mix everything together thouroughly. The residual heat from the pasta and bacon will gently cook the eggs and melt the cheese, resulting in an amazingly rich creamy sauce. Add some of the cooking water to achieve a more fluid consistency. Keep stirring until the sauce is silky and smooth, then serve and eat immediately.

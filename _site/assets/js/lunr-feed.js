        title: "Chicken and Coriander Broth",
        category: "soup",
        content: "\n\nI was clearing out my fridge a few weeks ago and came across a selection of root vegetables lurking there, waiting to be turned into something tasty. The first thing that came to my mind was soup, and since we were in the middle of winter I was thinking along the lines of a chunky, meaty broth. I decided on Chicken, which would provide my soup with both the chunky meat component and the stock. A bunch of fresh coriander which also happened to be in my fridge could be involved here in some way, I thought. I remembered a Madhur Jaffrey recipe for coriander chicken curry, involving large quantities of fresh coriander, resulting in a vibrant green curry sauce. It was fantastic, and so I reckoned it could work in my soup too. The earthiness of all those root vegetables would be balanced by the fresh zing of the coriander, perhaps. I prepared the chicken in my usual way; removed the breasts, then cut up the remaining carcass into small pieces and fried until nicely caramelised for the stock. This time I actually chopped up the wings and legs too and added them to the stock for extra flavour. Once the stock was almost ready, after an hour or so, I took some out to gently poach the breast meat in a separate pan. Once perfectly barely cooked, I allowed them to cool before carefully cutting them into dice. All the vegetables and chicken diced to the same size, making for an attractive looking bowl of broth.\n\n\n\n  1 free range chicken\n  1 carrot\n  1 onion\n  1 stick of celery\n  1/2 leek\n  2 cloves of garlic\n  1 teaspoon of coriander seeds, crushed\n  5 black peppercorns\n  150ml of dry sherry\n  150ml of red wine\n  75g of unsalted butter\n  chicken breasts\n  150g of carrot\n  150g of swede\n  150g of celeriac\n  1 onion\n  2 large cloves of garlic\n  1 large bunch of coriander\n  vegetable oil, for frying\n\n\n\n  \n    Remove the breasts from the chicken and set aside. Chop the remaining carcass, including the legs and wings, into small pieces. Cut all the vegetables into approx. 1cm dice, set aside. Get a large heavy based pan on a high heat and colour the bones in 2 batches until golden and caramelised. Add a knob of butter at the end of each batch and foam for a few minutes, to enrich and brown the bones further, then drain the butter off in a colander. Add the vegetables, the garlic, coriander seeds and peppercorns to the same pan, which should have some dark intense residue stuck to the bottom, and sweat gently for about 15- 20 minutes, until soft and sweet. All the tasty chicken residue should have melted into the vegetables. Put the chicken bones back into the pan, and add the sherry and red wine. Reduce the alcohol until completely dry, then cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, skimming any fat and scum that rises. Simmer gently for 2 hours, skimming frequently. Pass through a fine sieve and set aside.\n  \n  \n    When the stock is almost ready, ladle some out into a small pan and gently poach the chicken breasts, just covered with hot stock but not boiling, turning the breasts every few minutes. Remove when they are just barely cooked, and allow to cool. While the stock is cooking, prepare the vegetables for the broth: cut the carrot, celeriac, swede and onion into 5mm dice, and finely chop the garlic. Sweat the onion and garlic in vegetable oil for about 5 minutes, until soft. Add the carrot and cook for about 5 minutes, add the swede and cook for a further 2 minutes, then finally add the celeriac. Sweat until all the veg is nicely cooked, then remove from the heat. Cut the cooked chicken breast into 5mm dice and set aside. When the stock is ready, season to taste with salt and pour just enough over the diced vegetables, ensuring to leave it nice and thick. You may have some leftover. Add the chicken dice and gently warm through. Finally chop the coriander and stir through at the very end.\n  \n\n",

        category: "pork",
        content: "\n\nThe belly has long been my favourite part of the pig. There are two things I generally prefer to do with a pork belly; either salt it and cure it to make dry-cured bacon, or braise it long and slow, for about 12 hours, then press and chill it before roasting it until crispy. Pork belly cooked this way has the most amazing mouthfeel; the meat itself is succulent and has fat running through the layers that melts in your mouth, and the skin that sits atop is the most fantastic crisp pork crackling. It’s a great contrast of textures!\n\n\n\n  1 1/2kg of pork belly, skin on, bones removed but reserved\n  200g of pork trimmings, diced\n  2 rashers of smoked streaky bacon, diced\n  2 sprigs of thyme\n  fine sea salt, or table salt\n  1 sprig of sage\n  sea salt and cracked black pepper\n  400ml of medium dark ale\n  1 carrot\n  1/2 leek\n  1 onion\n  1 tomato\n  1/2 bulb of garlic\n  1 litre of chicken stock, unseasoned\n  20g of unsalted butter\n  a little beurre manie\n  1 spring cabbage\n  200g of baby spinach\n  20 spears of medium asparagus, points removed\n\n\n\n  \n    Heat the oven to 140C. To cook the pork belly, season it with 1 heaped teaspoon of fine salt and rub it into the flesh and skin side. Line a roasting tray that just fits it in snugly with greaseproof paper, and add water until just covered. Add a sprig of thyme and a few sage leaves, then place in the oven for 10-12 hours, until it is absolutely tender and almost falling apart when touching it with a spoon. Remove the liquid from the tray, and set aside. Now cover the belly with another sheet of greaseproof paper and press with another tray on top, followed by a heavy weight (2-3kg). Place in the fridge to chill for at least 6 hours.\n  \n  \n    To make the pork and ale sauce; take the reserved bones from the belly and cut into small pieces using a cleaver or a heavy pair of scissors. Cut the carrot, leek, onion and tomato into approx 1cm dice, and set aside. Lightly crush the garlic. In a large, heavy based pan, heat about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over a high heat. Saute the bones until golden, then strain in a colander. Reduce the heat to medium, and in the same pan, cook the vegetables with a generous pinch of salt for about 10 minutes. Add the pork bones back in, along with the rest of the thyme and a few sage leaves. Add the ale, and bring to the boil. Reduce until the liquid is completely gone, then add the reserved cooking liquid from the pork belly. Bring to the boil, and reduce until dry again. Add enough chicken stock until just covered, then simmer gently for 30 minutes. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve, and reduce by half, or until you have an intense flavour. Whisk in some beurre manie to thicken, adding just a little bit at a time. Set the sauce aside.\n  \n  \n    Heat the oven to 180C. Portion the pork belly into 4 equal sized pieces, and score the skin carefully in a criss-cross pattern. Add 3-4 tablespoons of vegetable oil to a large heavy based pan (with an oven-proof handle), then add the pork skin side down and place over a high heat. When it just starts to sizzle, place in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the skin is golden and very crispy.\n  \n  \n    While the pork belly is cooking, prepare the vegetables; fill a large pot with water and season generously with salt. Bring to the boil. Cut off the bottom 1-2 cm of the asparagus as it is woody and tough. Remove the outer 2 or 3 layers of the cabbage, and cut out the thick veins. Slice coarsely. Wash the baby spinach leaves, then set aside. When the pork belly is about 5 minutes away from finished, heat the butter in a large saute pan until foaming, then add the cabbage along with a pinch of salt. Cook until tender. Cook the asparagus in the boiling salted water until just tender - about 4 minutes. Finally, add the baby spinach to the pan with the cabbage and cook until wilted. Serve the pork belly on the bed of vegetables, and pour the sauce over.\n  \n\n",

        title: "Pasta Puttanesca",
        category: "pasta",
        content: "\n\nI’ve just received a slow cooker as a birthday present from my good friend Lewis, its fantastic because it allows me to braise meat and stews for a long time without having to be in the house. When I’m working all day I can have my dinner slowly cooking for when I get back. I make tomato sauce with the slow cooker; tinned tomatoes, onion, garlic, and tomato puree simmered gently for several hours until it is dark and reduced. I then puree and pass it through a fine sieve to make it extra smooth. What you get is an amazingly rich dark red sauce. This can be used for any number of things, but my current favourite is to make salty pungent puttanesca with it. This sauce is accompanied by spaghetti; literally “whore’s style spaghetti”, it’s packed with in-your-face flavours. Traditionally made with tomatoes, garlic, black olives, anchovies and capers, it’s salty and more-ish. It’s a good dish to have in your repertoire; because it’s made almost entirely with store cupboard ingredients it can be rustled up with just a moment’s notice, although in my recipe the tomato sauce is simmered for eight hours to make it extra rich. This isn’t essential but will make your sauce taste amazing. I recommend making a big batch of sauce and freezing it. As there are so many big and bold flavours going on here, I have added a good handful of parsley and basil to bring some freshness to the dish and vital splash of green, making it particularly eye-catching.\n\n\n\n  2 400g tins of peeled plum tomatoes\n  3 tablespoons of tomato puree\n  1 onion\n  5 large cloves of garlic\n  1 glass of red wine\n  extra virgin olive oil\n  1 tablespoon of sugar\n  1 large handful of pitted black olives\n  6 anchovy fillets\n  1 large bunch of flat leaf parsley\n  1 handful  of basil leaves\n  400g of tagliatelle\n\n\n\n  \n    To make the tomato sauce; finely slice the onion and sweat in a couple of glugs of olive oil with a generous pinch of salt until the onions are completely softened. Now finely chop the garlic cloves and add to the pot along with the tomatoes, tomato puree, sugar and red wine. Bring to the boil, then gently simmer for about 8 hours until the sauce is rich and dark. Puree the sauce in a blender and pass through a fine sieve. it should be fairly thick so that it coats the pasta nicely. If it’s too thin, simmer it gently to reduce further. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.\n  \n  \n    Cook your pasta according to the packet instructions while you finish the sauce: finely chop the anchovy fillets and gently fry in a little olive oil until they start to disintegrate, then add the tomato sauce and stir. Slice the olives and add to the sauce. Finely chop the parsley and roughly chop the basil and add to the sauce at the very end. When the pasta is ready, stir the sauce in; add just enough to coat the pasta nicely, it should be really thick. Serve with some red wine and crusy bread. Fantastic!\n  \n\n",

The process of salting and smoking fish was originally a method of preserving the fish to enable long storage. Although not necessary as a means of survival anymore, smoked fish - salmon and haddock in particular - is commonly enjoyed all over the country because it’s simply delicious! I recently had great pleasure in making Cullen Skink - the traditional Scottish soup made with smoked haddock - but since it has been so warm recently I wanted to do something a bit less hearty and filling. Some sort of salad seemed like the best thing to do, so I just warmed the fish gently in some milk, and flaked it over a simple salad of baby spinach, spring onions and courgette sliced thinly into ribbons.

        category: "pork",
        content: "\n\nPork fillets are easily obtainable and relatively inexpensive, but the best thing about them is they usually come with trimmings attached to them which must be removed before cooking; and with these trimmings you can make a quick and delicious homemade sauce with no pre-made stocks or artificial seasoning. Just simple fresh ingredients. This recipe is one of the easiest and most delicious things to do with a pork fillet, and personal favourite of mine. Grain mustard is a classic pairing for pork, and combined with creamy mashed potatoes and cabbage, it’s an absolute winner!\n\n\n\n  2 pork fillets\n  1 savoy cabbage\n  50ml of double cream\n  4 Maris Piper potatoes, or King Edward\n  65g of unsalted butter\n  30ml of whole milk\n  sea salt and cracked black pepper\n  ground white pepper\n  2 cloves of garlic\n  2 shallots\n  2 sprigs of thyme\n  1 bay leaf\n  1 sprig of sage\n  100ml of cooking brandy\n  1 teaspoon of wholegrain mustard\n  vegetable oil, for cooking\n\n\n\n  \n    Heat the oven to 170C. Prick the potatoes with a skewer, then place in the oven for about 1hr 30mins, until soft and cooked through. Cut the potatoes in half, then scoop the potato from the skins and either mash with a masher or pass through a sieve. Place into a wide-based pan, and over a medium-low heat, add ½ teaspoon of salt, and mix. Add 30g of the butter, one dice at a time, then add the milk. Continue to cook out until you have a completely smooth, silky texture. Adjust the seasoning with salt and white pepper if need be.\n  \n  \n    While you’re waiting for the potatoes, make the sauce: trim the pork fillets of all sinew, and cut off the small head or “chateau” from the end. Cut all the trimmings approximately 1cm dice. In a large, heavy-based pan, heat 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over a high heat. Season the trimmings with salt and black pepper, then fry until golden all over, and strain in a colander. Meanwhile, thinly slice the shallots, and crush the clove of garlic. Add the shallots, thyme, bay, sage and garlic to the same pan and turn the heat to medium. Add a pinch of salt, and gently cook the shallots for about 10 minutes, until they are soft. Add the pork trimmings back to the pan, along with the brandy. Boil, and reduce until completely dry. Now cover with cold water, and boil to reduce until dry. Repeat this 3 times, but on the last time, only reduce by half, then strain the sauce into a separate pan. Add the cream, and continue to reduce until you have a nice sauce consistency. Lastly, add the mustard, and mix.\n  \n  \n    To cook the pork fillet: heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large heavy-based pan over a high heat. Season the fillets all over with salt and white pepper. Fry the fillets all over until golden and caramelised. Place the pan in the oven for 3 minutes. Remove from the oven, and add the remaining 25g butter. Heat until foaming, then add 1 sprig of thyme and 1 crushed clove of garlic. Baste the pork fillet for about 2 minutes, turning over after 1 minute. Cook until the pork is still slightly pink in the middle. Transfer to a rack and leave in a warm place to rest for at least 10 minutes.\n  \n  \n    Prepare the cabbage: Remove and discard the dark green outer layers. Take the inner leaves off and remove the woody veins. Thinly slice the cabbage, then set aside. Heat a little vegetable oil in a wide-based pan over a medium-high heat, and saute the cabbage, with a pinch of salt, until lightly coloured. Turn the heat to low, then add the remaining 10g of butter. Cook gently until cabbage is tender taste, and add more salt if needed.\n  \n  \n    To serve, place a spoonful of the mashed potato in the centre of the plate, with a spoonful of cabbage next to it. Slice the pork fillet, and place on top. Spoon the sauce over.\n  \n\n",

        title: "Crab Salad",
        category: "crab",
        content: "\n\nOf all the delicious things in the world to eat, crab is easily one of my favourites. It’s got an intense flavour of the sea and it’s succulent, sweet and juicy. In short, it’s fantastic. Preparing crab involves a bit of work and is fairly time consuming… but it’s a labour of love and something I’d urge everyone to try. Cooked in generously seasoned water, the beautiful white meat is excellent whilst still warm, eaten straight from the shell. It hardly needs anything more, although mix it with a little mayonnaise, herbs and lemon juice and you have the beginnings of a delicious salad. I’ve been wanting to write a crab recipe for a while now, but found it difficult to think of a really photogenic looking dish that wasn’t just a rip-off from one of the restaurants I’ve worked in. The custard part of this dish is similar to a crab creme brulee that we did at Wedgwood, and it’s really tasty. The sweet flavour of crab infuses really well in cream, and the fresh herbs added at the end finish it off beautifully.\n\n\n\n  1 brown crab\n  1 carrot\n  1/2 leek\n  1 fennel\n  2 star anise\n  1 thyme\n  600ml of whipping cream\n  50ml of whole milk\n  1 parsley\n  1 dill\n  1 tarragon\n  1 baby gem lettuce\n  1 spring onion\n  1 chives\n  2 pieces of medium sliced white bread\n  6 egg yolks\n  cayenne pepper, or piment d’espelette\n  1 tablespoon of mayonnaise\n  2 tablespoons of croutons\n  lemon\n  sea salt\n\n\n\n  \n    Fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil. Season generously with salt (it should be almost as salty as the sea.) Drop the crab in the water, bring back to the boil, remove from the heat and allow to cool for at least 40 minutes. Remove the crab from the water, and place on a tray.\n  \n  \n    Break off the claws, and smash them carefully with a hammer or large knife, trying not to smash into too many small pieces. Separate the meat from the shell, trying to keep it in nice big chunks. Repeat the process with the legs. Now prise the body from the main shell of the crab, and remove and discard the lungs (“dead man’s fingers”). Cut the body in half and carefully scrape out the meat with a crab picker or use the handle of a teaspoon. Cut the pieces in half again and scrape more out - you’ll be surprised how much is hidden in all the cavities. Carefully check the crab meat for pieces of shell, cover and place in the fridge.\n  \n  \n    Heat the oven to 200C. Place a roasting tray in the oven until very hot, then add 3-4 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Smash all the crab shell into small pieces with a heavy knife or rolling pin, then place in the roasting tray. Stir once, then return to the oven for 30 minutes, stirring halfway.\n  \n  \n    Meanwhile, thinly slice all the vegetables, keeping the carrots separate. In a large pot, fry the carrots and star anise in a little vegetable oil with a generous pinch of salt, until lightly coloured. Add the rest of the vegetables and sweat over a medium heat for about 20 minutes.The shells should be lightly coloured. Deglaze the tray with the white wine, and reduce until dry. Add the shells to the pot of vegetables, and the tomato, roughly chopped. Add the cream to the pot, and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 30 minutes, then roughly chop the herbs (reserving some chives and dill for the salad) and add to the pot. Cover with clingfilm and leave to infuse for 30 minutes.\n  \n  \n    Pass the crab cream through a fine sieve, rinsing the shell pulp with the milk. Discard the pulp. Taste the cream and adjust the seasoning if it needs. Weigh the cream, and then place 1 egg yolk for every 100g of cream in a separate pan. Boil the cream, then pour slowly over the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Now heat the crab custard over a low heat, stirring constantly with a plastic spatula to ensure it doesn’t stick. When it is thick, and coats the back of the spatula (should be 80C), it is ready. Pour into 6 wide creme brulee dishes, filling only to 2mm deep. You may have some custard left over which you can just set in separate ramekins to be enjoyed on their own. Place the ramekins in the fridge to set, for at least two hours.\n  \n  \n    To make the crab salad: finely slice the lettuce and the spring onion, cut the reserved chives and pick the dill into fronds. Place everything in a bowl with the picked crab meat, the croutons and add just enough mayonnaise to lightly bind it together; you may not need all of it, it depends on how much crab meat you have. Season with sea salt if it needs, and lemon juice. Divide the mixture into 6 and place in the middle of the custard ramekins. Finally sprinkle over a little cayenne pepper.\n  \n\n",

        content: "\n\nI have long been an advocate of the humble button mushroom. It’s one of these ingredients that’s so commonplace, I reckon it’s not appreciated to its full potential. A staple in your greasy breakfast fry-up, or as a mediocre ‘cream of mushroom soup’, the button mushroom is actually so much better that you might realise. They are high in umami – the taste that makes things savory – and they have a lot of powerful flavour locked inside. One of their characteristics is that they have an extremely high water content, making the flavour rather bland until you have reduced the moisture. I’ve also found that when you fry them in a hot pan with a pinch of salt until they’re dark and caramelised, the flavour is amazingly intense and savory. This is what gave me the idea of doing a roast mushroom soup. It’d be better than the average mushroom soup as it would be a rich golden colour, instead of grey, and the resulting flavour would be all the more powerful.\n\n\n\n  450g of baby button mushrooms\n  1 onion\n  3 cloves of garlic\n  2 rashers  of streaky bacon\n  3 sprigs of rosemary\n  1 1/2litres of chicken stock\n  2 tablespoons of sea salt\n  4 tablespoons of olive oil\n\n\n\n  \n    Set 12 mushrooms aside, and slice the rest of them in half. Sprinkle the halved mushrooms with the sea salt so they’re evenly covered, then place in a colander set over a bowl. Leave in the fridge for about 6 hours, or overnight.\n  \n  \n    Heat the oven to 180C, and put a medium sized roasting tray in to heat up. Briefly rinse the mushrooms with cold water, then squeeze them with your hands to remove as much moisture as possible. Pat them dry with kitchen paper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in the roasting tray, then add the mushrooms along with 2 sprigs of rosemary. Roast the mushrooms, tossing occasionally, until they are dark and caramelised.\n  \n  \n    Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion and garlic, and dice the bacon. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium pot and fry the bacon over a high heat until crisp. Turn the heat down and sweat the onion and garlic slowly for about 20 minutes, until soft and sweet. Once the mushrooms are nicely coloured, remove the rosemary from the roasting tray and add the mushrooms to the pan of onions. Add about 1 litre of chicken stock - enough to just cover the mushrooms - and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover with a lid, and simmer for 30 minutes, topping up with chicken stock when it reduces too much.Blend the soup in a food processor on full power for 5 minutes, until you have a silky smooth texture. You may need to add a little more stock to get the required consistency.\n  \n  \n    To finish; slice the 12 reserved mushrooms in half, season with salt and saute them to get a nice roasted colour. Pick the leaves from the remaining rosemary sprig and fry these in olive oil until just crisp. Scatter the mushrooms and rosemary over the soup along with a drizzle of olive oil.\n  \n\n\n",

It’s so hot today I have opened all the windows and there is a warm breeze blowing through the room.

        content: "\n\nLamb chops were always a staple part of our diet when we were young, usually simply roasted and served with baked potatoes and veg from the garden; simple but delicious. The loin meat from the top half of the saddle - the best end - is some of nicest and most tender from the whole animal. Keep the chops attached and you have a rack of lamb, perfect to roast whole and carve into classic lamb cutlets. The bottom half of the saddle - the short saddle - does not have any rib bones and so you would normally just roast this as a piece of loin. What we do in the restaurant is a little more special however; we take the loin from the bone, leaving a flap of the belly fat attached, then make a stuffing from sauteed kidneys and spinach and roll the loin up inside the fat. The saddle is then tied with string and roasted. It’s a lovely way to cook the loin meat as it’s quite well protected from the surrounding fat.\n\n\n\n  1 short saddle of lamb, belly flaps attached\n  2 lamb kidneys\n  200g of baby spinach\n  6 pitted black olives\n  1 shallot\n  1 small clove of clove of garlic\n  3 green courgettes\n  3 yellow courgettes\n  extra virgin olive oil\n  vegetable oil, for frying\n  sea salt and cracked black pepper\n\n\n\n  \n    Carefully remove the bone from the short saddle, being careful not to leave any of the meat attached to the bone. Trim off the skin from the layer of fat, being very careful not to make any holes in the flap, as we need this intact in order to wrap around the loins. You now have 2 pieces of loin with a flap of fat attached to each. Place the layer of fat on a chopping board and bash it out with the flat part of a heavy knife, to flatten the fat to a nice thin layer. Again, be careful not to make any holes. Place the loins in the fridge.\n  \n  \n    Get a medium pan hot on the stove, and sautee the spinach with a pinch of salt until gently wilted. Transfer to a colander and leave to chill in the fridge. Meanwhile, finely chop the shallot and garlic and sweat slowly in olive oil until soft. Transfer to a bowl. Roughly chop the black olive and add to the bowl. Now take the lamb kidneys and remove the outer membrane. Cut in half lengthways and cut out the white gristle from inside. Cut the kidneys into 5mm dice, then fry in a hot pan until lightly coloured. Remove, and add to the bowl with the shallots, garlic and olive. Once the spinach is cold, squeeze all the remaining moisture from it by wringing in your hands. Mix together with the kidney and shallot mixture. Season to taste with salt and cracked black pepper.\n  \n  \n    Divide the mix into two, one half for each loin. Lay out the loin on a board with the fat facing towards you. Place the spinach mix tight into the join of where the loin meets the fat, then roll it up, with the fat wrapping around the loin. Tie securely with butcher’s twine. Repeat with the other loin. Place the stuffed saddles in the fridge for 30 minutes to set.\n  \n  \n    Heat the oven to 180C. Cut 2mm slices off the courgettes lengthways, taking only the vibrant skin from the outside, and reserve the inner white part for another recipe. Cut the slices into thin strips. Set aside. Get a heavy based frying pan hot on the stove, and fry the stuffed saddles until lightly coloured all over. Place in the oven for 3 minutes, then turn over. Return to the oven for 5 minutes, or until the inside temperature reaches 55C, which is medium rare. Leave the meat to rest on a rack for 15-20 minutes. Just before carving the meat, saute the courgettes in olive oil until just cooked, and season with sea salt. Carve each loin into 3 pieces, and place on top of the spaghetti of courgettes. Serve with some nice crusty bread and a glass of white wine.\n  \n\n\n",

        content: "\n\nI have always been a huge fan of garlic. It’s an awesome ingredient that provides a remarkable amount of flavour given its size… it is small but strong! Obviously it’s more potent when raw, and when used for something like pesto or hummus, you need only a tiny bit. After cooking garlic, however, it loses most of it’s kick and becomes much more mellow. So, if you’re making a pasta sauce for example, you might want a decent amount - 3 or 4 cloves perhaps - to sweat with olive oil for the base of the sauce. Roasting garlic increases the mellowing effect even more, and gives it an amazing deep flavour. This is my favourite way to prepare garlic, and it’s perfect for making soup.\n\n\n\n  8 bulbs of garlic\n  1 sprig of rosemary\n  300ml of double cream\n  500ml of brown chicken stock\n  1 onion\n  sea salt\n  cracked black pepper\n  1 bunch of chives\n  olive oil\n  1 potato, about 50g\n\n\n\n  \n    Heat the oven to 170C. Add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a roasting tray and get it hot. Reserve 3 cloves for the garnish later, then cut the tops off the bulbs of garlic so the tips of the cloves are poking out, then add to the roasting tray along with the rosemary and roast for about 45 minutes until the garlic is completely soft and oozing out of its skins.\n  \n  \n    Meanwhile finely slice the onion and sweat in a medium pot with olive oil, and a pinch of sea salt. Cook over a medium heat for about 25 minutes until the onion is soft, sweet and slightly caramelised. Peel the potato and finely slice it. Add to the pot and continue to cook, stirring occasionally. Squeeze the garlic out of its skins and add the soft pulp to the pot along with the cream and brown chicken stock. Simmer gently for 20 minutes, then pour everything into a food processor and blend until completely pureed and silky smooth. If it’s a little too thick, add a splash of chicken stock.\n  \n  \n    To garnish the soup, finely slice the 3 reserved garlic cloves with a sharp knife (or a mandolin, if you have one) and saute in a little olive oil until they are lightly coloured. Be careful as they will taste bitter if you let them get too dark. Scatter these over the soup along with some finely chopped chives.\n  \n\n",

Our sauce would nearly always contain some lamb due to the abundant supply in our freezer. The mince from our own lamb was usually quite fatty and, when mixed in equal parts with lean beef mince, gave a lovely depth of flavour and body to the sauce. It always tasted fantastic; ladled onto a mountain of spaghetti with handfuls of grated parmesan I would devour it with gusto. Lamb bolognese is almost unheard of, which is a shame because it’s so delicious! In my view this is tastier than the classic beef bolognese and I bet that many would agree. Saying that, the recipe I’ve made here is not a plain spag-bol but a modified version, or upgraded, I should say. I made it a little bit creamier than usual, and added extra garlic. A good pile of baby spinach is thrown in and wilted down to tangle with the spaghetti as everything is mixed together. Parmesan cheese is mixed in, along with a splash of the salted starchy pasta water and finally some cherry tomatoes at the very last just to warm through gently. The final sauce is really rich and creamy, with the spinach and tomatoes giving a juiciness that stands up to the strong flavoured lamb.\n\n\n\n  500g of lamb mince\n  3 rashers of smoked streaky bacon\n  1 onion\n  1 carrot\n  1 stick of celery\n  3 large cloves of garlic\n  250ml of red wine\n  50g of tomato puree\n  1 litre of lamb stock, or chicken stock\n  1/2 teaspoon of dried chilli flakes\n  50ml of double cream\n  100g of baby spinach leaves\n  100g of parmesan\n  2 sprigs  of thyme\n  400g of dried spaghetti\n  olive oil\n  sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper\n\n\n\n  \n    Cut the bacon into 5mm dice and in a large, wide-based pan, fry in olive oil until golden and crisp.

Pick the leaves from the sprigs of thyme and add to the pan along with the chilli flakes. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the lamb mince, red wine, tomato puree and stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 1.5 hours, or until the lamb is tender and the sauce reduced and thick.\n  \n  \n    Cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions. While the pasta is cooking, add the cream and spinach to the bolognese and stir until all the spinach has wilted. Add the parmesan and mix thoroughly to melt the cheese and emulsify it into the sauce. The sauce should now be thick and creamy. Half the cherry tomatoes and have them ready. When the pasta is done, drain in a colander, reserving the starchy liquid. Add the pasta along with the cherry tomatoes into the sauce and mix well. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt or parmesan if needed. Serve immediately\n  \n\n",

It’s a really nice way to prepare chicken, and pretty easy too. I like chicken legs because they have so much more flavour than the breast meat, and by removing the bones and sinew they become an effortless pleasure to eat. The great thing about this dish is when you slice the chicken leg you see the beautiful glistening cross-section of the muscle, outlined by the crispy pancetta. I served it with sautéed button mushrooms, courgettes and a white wine cream sauce, generously finished with chopped parsley and a handful of baby spinach gently wilted through the sauce at the end. I love cooking vegetables and sauce together like this, in a kind of ragout…I advise a generous heap to present your chicken on, and have it with a salad and some nice white wine.\n\n\n\n  4 chicken thighs\n  12 rashers of thinly sliced pancetta\n  400g of button mushrooms\n  75g of baby spinach\n  2 courgettes\n  1 handful of flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped\n  3 cloves of garlic\n  250 ml  of white wine\n  300 ml  of whipping cream\n  2 shallots\n  1 sprig of rosemary, leaves picked\n  vegetable oil, for frying\n  sea salt and cracked black pepper\n\n\n\n  \n    Remove the skin from the chicken thighs, and carefully remove the bone and gristly bits.

        category: "quiche",
        content: "\n\nThe Bouchon collection is a set of recipe books by one of my idols; Thomas Keller of The French Laundry. Bouchon is the three Michelin starred chef’s bistro in Yountville, California that serves French classics like beef bourguignon, salt cod brandade, and quiche. There is a chapter on the quiche where Keller talks about the lost art of making great quiche; something which seems to have gone out of fashion, or forgotten about. A proper quiche will be two inches deep, filled to the very brim with a barely set, perfectly light custard. The shortcrust pastry should be rich and crisp, and specifically 4-5mm thick, so that it remains crisp and doesn’t become soggy after cooking. I had a couple of attempts at this quiche before getting a satisfactory result, and I was pleased with my third try. I actually bought a 9″ quiche ring especially for the task as none of the pastry rings in my house were quite the right size. One of the brilliant things about this recipe is the lightness of the custard; Keller blitzes the custard mix in a blender before pouring into the pastry shell, aerating the mix and resulting in a delicate light filling. This recipe is more or less the same as that found in Bouchon, but I’ve added spinach to the filling and converted the ingredients from pounds and ounces to kilograms.\n\n\n\n  350g of plain white flour\n  225g of unsalted butter, chilled\n  65ml of ice cold water\n  1 teaspoon of salt\n  500ml of whole milk\n  500ml of double cream\n  6 eggs\n  1 tablespoon of sea salt\n  1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground white pepper\n  6 gratings of fresh nutmeg\n  3 leeks\n  200g of baby spinach\n  150g of roquefort cheese, crumbled\n  olive oil\n\n\n\n  \n    To make the pastry: cut the butter into small dice, and rub into the flour and salt with fingertips until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Mix the water in and knead very briefly to incorporate. Don’t overwork. Wrap, and refrigerate for at least an hour, preferably overnight.\n  \n  \n    Roll the pastry out until you have a circle about 35cm in diameter and 3-4 mm thick. Take a 9 x 2 inch plain ring and place on a tray lined with parchment paper. Carefully line the ring with the pastry, being careful to press evenly into the sides and corners. Leave about an inch of pastry hanging over the edge. This will help prevent it from shrinking inwards when baking. Reserve trimmings for patching any cracks in the pastry later. Heat the oven to 190 C. Place the pastry shell in the fridge or freezer for at least 20 minutes before cooking.\n  \n  \n    Now line the pastry with a round of parchment paper and fill with dried beans or rice, pressing gently to fill the shell completely. Blind-bake the pastry for 35 to 45 minutes, until the outside of the pastry is golden and crisp but the inside still light. Remove the beans and parchment paper and return the shell to the oven for a further 20-30 minutes, until golden and crisp inside and out. Patch any cracks with the trimmings, returning to the oven for a further 5 minutes.\n  \n  \n    Heat the oven to 165 C, then prepare the filling: take three large leeks and slice thinly, discarding the dark green part or reserving for another recipe. Cook in a large pot of salted boiling water for 3-4 minutes, until tender. Drain on kitchen paper. Wilt the spinach by searing in a hot pan with a glug of olive oil, adding a pinch of salt. Mix with the cooked leeks. For the batter, heat the milk, cream and salt in a pan until a skin just begins to form on the surface. Place 3 eggs, half the cream mixture, 3 gratings of nutmeg and half the white pepper in a blender and blitz for about 30 seconds until foamy and light. Spread out half the leek mixture and half the roquefort in the bottom of the quiche shell, and pour over enough batter to just cover. Repeat with the remaining filling and batter mix. Fill the quiche to the very brim. Reserve any left over filling. Carefully place in the oven being careful not to spill any of the mix. Cook for about 1 ½ hours, until the quiche is nicely brown and the custard just set when jiggled. After about 20 minutes the custard will have sunk slightly in the middle as some of the air escapes the mix; simply top up with the leftover batter and return to the oven. Refrigerate for at least a day, or up to 3 days, until completely set. Slice into portions and reheat gently in the oven. Alternatively, it is just as excellent eaten cold.\n  \n\n\n",

Jerusalem is an ancient city with a turbulent history; having been besieged, conquered and captured countless times. As a result it’s a city of many varying cultures, religions and traditions, and the food of Jerusalem reflects this diversity. Hummus is a big thing in the middle east, especially in Jerusalem, and unsurprisingly there is an endless debate from opposing cultures about how it should be prepared; warm or cold… smooth and creamy or rustic and chunky. And which spices or garnishes to accompany it, if any at all. Most of the hummus I have had from the shops here in the UK have been almost smooth with a slight grainy texture to them. This recipe from Ottolenghi is really smooth and creamy, and much lighter in colour than hummus I’ve had before. It’s opened my eyes to how great hummus can be… I definitely recommend you try it!

The first thing that came to my mind was soup, and since we were in the middle of winter I was thinking along the lines of a chunky, meaty broth. I decided on Chicken, which would provide my soup with both the chunky meat component and the stock. A bunch of fresh coriander which also happened to be in my fridge could be involved here in some way, I thought. I remembered a Madhur Jaffrey recipe for coriander chicken curry, involving large quantities of fresh coriander, resulting in a vibrant green curry sauce. It was fantastic, and so I reckoned it could work in my soup too. The earthiness of all those root vegetables would be balanced by the fresh zing of the coriander. I prepared the chicken in my usual way; removed the breasts, then cut up the remaining carcass into small pieces and fried until nicely caramelised for the stock. This time I actually chopped up the wings and legs too and added them to the stock for extra flavour. Once the stock was almost ready, after an hour or so, I took some out to gently poach the breast meat in a separate pan. Once perfectly barely cooked, I allowed them to cool before carefully cutting them into dice. All the vegetables and chicken diced to the same size, making for an attractive looking bowl of broth.\n\n\n\n  2 guineafowl legs\n  200g of puy lentils\n  3 rashers of smoked streaky bacon\n  1 carrot\n  100g of swede\n  100g of celeriac\n  1 sprig of thyme\n  1 bay leaf\n  1 handful of baby spinach\n  1 bunch  of parsley\n  1 clove of garlic\n  1 onion\n  sea salt and cracked black pepper\n  olive oil\n  white wine vinegar\n  unsalted butter\n  300g of duck or goose fat\n  300ml of chicken stock\n\n\n\n  \n    Sprinkle the guinea fowl legs in sea salt and cracked black pepper and place in the fridge overnight, or 8 hours. Rinse the salt off, then place in a pot just big enough to fit them in snugly. Add the duck fat, and cook gently for about 1 hour, or until the legs are tender. Transfer to a container, pour the fat over and refrigerate. Leave for at least one week for the flavours to mature, or up to 2 months. The confit will keep for a long time preserved like this.\n  \n  \n    To make the lentils; finely dice the onion and fry gently in olive oil with a pinch of salt until soft. Rinse the lentils under cold water, then add to the pot along with the bay leaf and thyme. Add just enough chicken stock to cover, bring to the boil, then simmer for about 20 minutes until the lentils are tender.\n  \n  \n    Meanwhile, cut the bacon into lardons, and peel and dice the carrot, celeriac and swede into 5mm dice. In a frying pan, cook the lardons in olive oil until crisp, then add the diced vegetables. Turn the heat down, add a pinch of salt and sweat until the veg is tender. Set aside.\n  \n  \n    Heat the oven to 180C. Get the confit legs out of the fat, and scrape off any excess. Fry them in a hot pan skin side down, pressing to flatten slightly, then place in the centre of the oven for about 20 minutes, until the skin is crispy and the meat is heated through.\n  \n  \n    When the lentils are ready, drain off and reserve the stock, then add the vegetables and bacon.

Probably closer to minestrone than tomato, It’s thick and hearty, guaranteed to fill you up. Instead of pasta, as in a typical minestrone, this soup has a handful of rice thrown in the beginning which swells up to thicken the liquid and give it some body. You could use lentils instead, if you prefer. This is a chunky, broth-like soup rather than being smooth and silky, and although I like to cut all the vegetables to a nice uniform shape and size, you can cut them any old way and be as rustic as you like. As with many soups, the quality of this one comes down to the stock. I will usually make this soup after cooking a joint of smoked gammon or bacon, using the delicious salty liquid as the meaty backbone for my tomatoey broth. I highly advise this, if not then some nice vegetable stock is an acceptable alternative. This soup is best enjoyed with freshly baked bread and butter. As for us, we were treated to Dad’s crusty baguettes, still piping hot from the oven\n\n\n\n  2litres of smoked ham stock, or vegetable stock\n  6 rashers of streaky bacon\n  2 carrots\n  2 onions\n  3 sticks of celery\n  30g of basmati rice\n  4 cloves of garlic\n  1/2 teaspoons of dried thyme\n  1/2 teaspoons of dried oregano\n  2 400g tins of chopped tomatoes\n  2 tablespoons of tomato puree\n  sea salt and cracked black pepper\n  a  handful of basil or parsley leaves\n\n\n\n  Cut the bacon into lardons and, in a large pot, fry until crispy. Meanwhile, cut the carrot, onion and celery into 5mm dice, and peel and finely chop the garlic. Once the bacon is nice and caramelised, add the onion, garlic and celery. Turn the heat down and sweat gently for 15 minutes, until the onions are soft and dark. Add the basmati rice, carrots, thyme and oregano and fry over a medium heat for 5 minutes. Now add the tomatoes, the tomato puree and the stock. Bring to the boil then simmer gently for 30 minutes. Finish with some torn or chopped basil leaves, then and serve with fresh crusty bread.\n\n\n",

        content: "\n\nConfit is one of my favourite ways of cooking meat; with something like a duck leg the meat will be amazingly tender and succulent, and the crisp crunchy skin giving a lovely texture contrast. It’s hard not to adore this. Chicken confit is not often heard of, but it’s a great way to elevate the humble chicken leg to new tasty new heights. Lemon chicken was something my mum often made when we were young. Simply place some chicken legs in a roasting tray with olive oil, lemons and seasoning and roast in a hot oven until golden and crisp. You get a load of amazingly tasty juices in the tray which are spooned over potatoes or mopped up with crusty bread. One of my favourite ever meals! So this is a new version of that dish; the confit chicken has a superior texture, and the lemon and olive oil dressing is enriched with the jus from the confit and loaded with chopped fresh herbs. For this one, I served it with some sauteed pak choi and buttered new potatoes.\n\n\n\n  4 chicken legs, or thighs\n  600g of duck or goose fat\n  2 tablespoons of coarse sea salt\n  2 lemons\n  5 tablespoons of olive oil\n  1 small handful of chives\n  1 small handful of parsley\n  1 small handful of tarragon\n  a few drops of white wine vinegar\n  sea salt and cracked black pepper\n\n\n\n  \n    Firstly, cure the chicken legs by placing them in a tray and rubbing in a couple of handfuls of the coarse sea salt. Cover, and leave in the fridge for 6-8 hours.\n  \n  \n    Set the oven to 140C. Wash off the salt from the chicken legs, then place in a pot and add enough duck fat to just cover them. Bring up to temperature on the stove to melt the fat, then cover and place in the oven for about 1 hour, or until the meat is just tender and almost falling off the bone. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely in the fat. If you wish you can store the chicken legs like this in the fridge for several weeks.\n  \n  \n    Remove the chicken legs from the fat. There will be a layer of chicken jus settled in the bottom of the pot; take this and reserve it for the dressing, it’s delicious! Get a pan hot on the stove, and fry the legs in a few tablespoons of vegetable oil until the skin is golden and very crisp. While the chicken legs are cooking, make the dressing. Mix the chicken jus with the juice of two lemons, and whisk in the olive oil gradually. Finally add the herbs, and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper and a few drops of white wine vinegar.\n  \n\n\n",

        content: "\n\nYears ago my friend Cecily showed me how to make risotto, she was so enthusiastic about the merits of this dish and was amazed that I’d never made it before! It was the start of a beautiful relationship with this Italian classic; now a staple in my repertoire, I must have made hundreds of risottos, including a few variations…barley is a nice alternative to rice and perfect to serve with chicken. We feed barley to the hens on the farm, so this seems like an apt combination for a dish. A benefit of using barley instead of rice is that it’s considerably more difficult to overcook. Also the grains give a lovely bursting sensation when you chew them which is fantastic. Firstly, I like to caramelise some finely diced pancetta or home-cured bacon to release some vital fat and get an amazing flavour base before adding finely chopped onion to sweat down slowly and gently. I will sweat the onion for a good fifteen minutes before adding anything else, making sure they become soft and sweet. To add some extra flavour and a nice touch of colour, I cooked some carrot dice and some baby button mushrooms in a separate pan to be stirred into the risotto at the very end, along with a generous handful of chopped herbs.\n\n\n\n  400g of pearl barley\n  2 onions\n  3 cloves of garlic\n  75g of streaky bacon\n  250ml of dry white wine\n  1 1/2litres of chicken stock\n  125g of baby button mushrooms\n  2 carrots\n  1 handful of chives, finely chopped\n  1 handful of parsley, finely chopped\n  80g of parmesan\n  150g of unsalted butter\n  vegetable oil, for frying\n  olive oil\n  sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper\n  8 chicken thighs or drumsticks\n\n\n\n  \n    Heat the oven to 180C, toss the chicken drumsticks in olive oil and roast for about 30 minutes, until golden and crisp.\n  \n  \n    Cut the pancetta into small dice and fry in a little oil until nicely coloured. Finely chop the onion and add to the pan, turning the heat down. Gently sweat for at least 15minutes until the onions have turned soft and sweet. Finely chop the garlic and add to the pan.\n  \n  \n    Rinse the barley for a few minutes under cold water, then add to the pan. Turn the heat up and stir for a minute, then add the white wine. Stir until the alcohol has boiled off, then turn the heat to medium and add your chicken stock, one ladle at a time, stirring frequently.\n  \n  \n    Cut the carrot into approx. 5mm dice and fry in some vegetable oil a separate pan until slightly caramelised and just cooked. Drain on kitchen paper. Quarter the mushrooms and do the same with them.\n  \n\n\n",

It is traditionally served with finely chopped shallots, parsley, capers and gherkins, and I have learned that there is some debate about how many extra ingredients to add to the meat. Some like to include condiments such as Worcester sauce, tomato ketchup, mustard, lemon juice and even brandy. One thing is pretty indisputable though, which is that the meat – being the central aspect of the dish – should be of the highest possible quality. I have had discussions about steak tartare with Alan, fellow Wedgwood chef, who believes that this dish is a pure and simple celebration of meat and should be accompanied by little more than some herbs and seasoning. I appreciate his sentiment and agree that the dish should simple, but I do like to include a couple of extra ingredients…\n\n\n\n  100g of beef sirloin, or fillet\n  30g of shallot, finely chopped\n  1 teaspoon of parsley, finely chopped\n  1 teaspoon of capers, finely chopped\n  1 teaspoon of gherkins, finely chopped\n  sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper\n  1 egg yolk\n\n\n\n  With a sharp knife, carefully cut the beef into small dice.

We would perch on tiny plastic stools with soup and chopsticks in hand, slurping down the powerful broth while millions of motorbikes provided a symphony of background humming. The most common – and best – was pho bo, rich dark beef stock laden with strips of tender meat and tendons of beef, fragrant spices and light noodles. There was always a basket of bright leaves served alongside, herb-like greens which, when torn in rustic pieces into the bowl gave the perfect balance of freshness to the meaty soup. This is my own, slightly simpler version of noodle broth. Although it doesn’t compare to proper Vietnamese pho it’s a reasonable substitute! To make this recipe you will need to invest some time in making proper beef stock. This takes at least eight hours of gentle simmering and I urge you to do this; the resulting flavour will be far superior than any shop-bought alternative. I haven’t added any actual meat to the soup as I reckoned there is enough flavour from the stock alone, but feel free to add some strips of cooked beef if you wish.\n\n\n\n  3kg of beef bones\n  2 carrots\n  1 onion\n  1/2 bulb of garlic, cut in two crossways\n  1 sprig of thyme\n  1 bay leaf\n  250ml of red wine\n  1 fresh red chilli, finely sliced\n  20g of root ginger, finely sliced\n  2 celery sticks\n  1 leek, white part only, finely sliced\n  4 spring onions\n  100g of dried egg noodles\n  sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper\n  soy sauce\n  toasted sesame oil\n\n\n\n  \n    Firstly make the beef stock: Heat the oven to 200C and roast the bones until dark golden brown. Meanwhile, roughly chop 1 carrot and the onion and, along with the garlic, lightly brown in vegetable oil in a large pan. Add the wine and boil for 3 minutes to remove the alcohol. Add the beef bones, the thyme and bay leaf. Fill with cold water until just covered, then slowly bring to the boil, skimming any scum that rises. Simmer very gently for 8 hours, topping up with more cold water when necessary. Strain off the liquid into a clean pan, and boil until reduced to about 1 litre. For the last 10 minutes add the ginger and chilli. Season carefully with salt, and set aside.\n  \n  \n    Bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Peel the carrot into ribbons and finely slice. Peel the celery and finely slice. Add all the vegetables except the spring onion to the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes. Lift out with a slotted spoon and rinse under cold water.\n  \n  \n    Cook the noodles in the boiling vegetable water for 4 minutes, then drain. Divide the noodles and vegetables between 4 bowls, then ladle the hot beef stock over the top. Sprinkle the spring onions over the top, and serve.\n  \n\n\n",

It’s easy to rustle up pretty quickly, and if you make your own authentic caesar dressing as we did, it’s proper and delicious too. The dressing is key to this dish; it’s a super-enriched mayonnaise, packed with powerful savoriness from garlic, parmesan, anchovies and olive oil. The richness is balanced by a vital squeeze of lemon juice. We always used chicken breast, gently baked in the oven until just cooked, but I’ve switched to using leg now as the darker flakey meat has more flavour and a more pleasing rustic feel that is nicely suited to this dish. This salad provides a fantastic interplay of textures; balancing juicy shredded chicken with crunchy fresh leaves of lettuce and crisp bacon, all bound happily together by the glossy rich dressing. Extra crunch is given by lovely golden croutons.\n\n\n\n  2 chicken legs\n  2 baby gem lettuce\n  4 rashers of dry-cured streaky bacon\n  2 slices of thick white bread\n  100ml of olive oil, plus a little extra for cooking\n  2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese, grated\n  1 anchovy\n  1 lemon\n  1 egg yolk\n  1 clove of garlic, finely chopped\n  sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper\n\n\n\n  \n    Heat the oven to 180C.

Whisk (or use a blender) until all incorporated and smooth, then begin to add the olive oil, very gradually, until it is emulsified and you have a thick mayonnaise. Add a squeeze of lemon juice to taste, and a couple of tablespoons of water until you have a sauce-like consistency. Season with salt, if needed. Pick and wash the lettuce leaves, and to finish the salad, simply toss everything together with the dressing and throw in a bowl.\n  \n\n\n",

I already wrote about pies when I did a series of posts on classic home cooking, namely my delicious steak pie and shepherd’s pie but I really felt that chicken pie needed to be added to the collection since this meat is so popular. I was thrifty with this dish, wasting nothing, as one always should when eating meat. I took one small bird and got maximum use from it, roasting the meat on the bone then using the carcass to make some stock. I then reduced this down to intensify the flavour and enriched it with sherry and a little beurre manié to make the gravy for the pie. This dish will take most of the day to cook, but I make no apologies for this. I hate to compromise flavour for the sake of saving time. In any case, there are few things that I enjoy more than spending all afternoon in the kitchen creating something delicious. I served it with some leeks sauteed in butter, and it was fantastic.\n\n\n\n  1 free range chicken\n  200g of smoked ham, cut into chunks\n  50g of unsalted butter\n  500g of puff pastry\n  some beurre manie\n  2 handfuls of flat leaf parsley\n  1 bunch  of basil leaves\n  1 sprig of thyme, leaves picked\n  1/2 onion\n  1 stick of celery\n  2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped\n  100ml of dry sherry\n\n\n\n  \n    Heat the oven to 180C. Soften the butter and using your fingers rub all over the chicken and in between the skin and breast meat. Roughly chop the basil and half of the parsley and also stuff this under the skin of the breast. Season liberally with sea salt and place the chicken in a roasting dish into the oven for about 1 hour and 30 minutes or until the meat is just cooked, tender and juicy basting with the juices and butter every 20 minutes.\n  \n  \n    When the chicken has cooled slightly, take all of the meat off the carcass and roughly chop. Set aside. To make the stock: Now break the carcass up into small pieces using a meat hammer or cleaver. Set a deep, thick bottomed pan over a high heat and pour in a couple of glugs of vegetable oil or rapeseed oil. Fry the chicken bones, turning occasionally, until they are uniformly golden brown. Add 1 carrot, the onion, celery and garlic and fry for a couple of minutes. Pour in enough cold water to just cover the bones and bring to the boil, skimming any froth or fat that rises to the surface. Simmer gently for 4 hours.\n  \n  \n    Strain the stock into a separate pan, add a glassful of dry cooking sherry and boil until reduced by 1/3. Take the 2 remaining carrots and cut into chunky dice. Cook these until tender in the stock while it is reducing, removing them with a slotted spoon once done. Whisk in a few pieces of beurre manié into the reduced stock until a nice gravy consistency is achieved. Stir in the remaining parsley and the thyme, roughly chopped, and add the carrots, chicken meat and smoked ham. Season carefully with salt and pepper, then leave to cool completely.\n  \n  \n    Now to build the pie: roll out the puff pastry to about 5mm thick. Pour the chicken mixture into a pie dish and drape the pastry over, pushing the edges down with a fork. Use the trimmings to decorate the top. Make two slits for steam to escape, then brush liberally with egg wash. Place in the oven at 180C until the pastry is nice and golden.\n  \n\n\n",

The last time I made it I couldn’t find the recipe so had to improvise and, although tasty, it wasn’t as good as the original. The old recipe was an adaptation of the red onion chutney that we used to make at Blackmore’s. I changed the spices and added white wine for extra flavour. It has a fantastic rich sweetness that is hard not to adore. This chutney, as with many pickles, improves and matures with age.

In expanding my culinary repertoire I will embrace all types of food equally, both sweet and savoury! Tarte Tatin is a dessert that we used to do for lunch at Wedgwood; it’s a classic French dish, delicious and quite easy to make. As with a lot of food I love, I really appreciate the simplicity of it. The combination of rich sweet caramel and tart apples is balanced beautifully by the smoothness from the butter; these are flavours that were made for each other. It’s the prime season for apples right now so this is a good time to make it! I’ve never tried making puff pastry from scratch before, as I know it’s a time consuming process, but I’d like to do it some time. I’ll put a recipe up on here when I do, but for now I’m just using ready-rolled pastry from the shop which is of pretty good quality anyway and saves a lot of time. Just four ingredients make up this amazing dessert: apples, sugar, butter and puff pastry. As for the apples, a tart eating variety is needed – I recommend Cox as the best option as they have a great flavour and also hold their shape well when cooked instead of turning mushy. Since it’s such a simple dish, the quality of each individual ingredient is more important so I would suggest getting a block of some really nice expensive butter for this. Desserts are a luxury anyway so you might as well do it properly!\n\n\n\n  4 cox apples\n  100g of caster sugar\n  30g of unsalted butter, chilled\n  400g of puff pastry\n\n\n\n  \n    Heat the oven to 180C. Put the caster sugar in an even layer into a metal handled frying pan (approx 20cm diameter) and place over a low heat until the sugar has caramelised to a uniform golden brown.\n  \n  \n    While the sugar is heating, peel, core and slice the apples into eighths. Roll out the puff pastry to about 2-3mm thickness and cut a circle about 1/2 an inch wider than the inner diameter of the frying pan.\n  \n  \n    Cut the butter into small dice and set aside. Once the caramel is ready, add the butter in a even layer followed immediately by the apples, rounded sides down. Leave to cook for 2 minutes until the caramel has softened and the butter has melted.\n  \n  \n    Cover carefully with the puff pastry and tuck the edges in. Prick the top several times with a sharp knife to allow steam to escape. Now place in the oven for 15 minutes until the pastry is cooked through, nice and golden.\n  \n  \n    Have a cooling rack ready; remove the tarte from the oven and leave for 1 minute, then quickly turn it out onto the rack upside-down. The caramelised apples should release from the pan nicely. Leave to cool slightly, then eat! Excellent with vanilla ice-cream.\n  \n\n\n",

        title: "Chocolate Mousse",
        category: "chocolate",
        content: "\n\nFor the last six months at work I’ve been on desserts, getting to grips with the complexities of sugar, caramel, chocolate and eggs in all their different forms (not to mention all the fantastic fruit and berries in season just now!). Chocolate is a steadfast ingredient in any dessert menu and quite fascinating to work with. Recently I have just learned how to temper chocolate to give it an amazingly shiny, brittle finish. It’s not the easiest thing to achieve; a precise technique that’s really satisfying when it works properly! Another thing I’ve been getting my head around is chocolate mousse; a classic dessert which is subtly difficult to perfect. I remember making it when I was young; whipped cream folded into melted chocolate, always resulting in a smooth but rather dense and rich mousse. A perfect mousse should be really light and have a true melt-in-the-mouth texture; not what I have in my memories of childhood! The lightness comes from incorporating whipped cream and whipped egg whites into the melted chocolate, but the result depends of the temperature of the chocolate; too hot and the air will collapse from the mousse; too cold and the chocolate will sieze up and become grainy. This recipe works well, the secret here is to heat and whisk egg yolks with sugar and water (or coffee, as in this recipe) to create a silky light sabayon which the chocolate is then melted into. From there I add whipped cream, and lastly some soft whipped egg whites to make it extra light and aerated.\n\n\n\n  200g of good quality dark chocolate (70%)\n  200g of double cream\n  75g of caster sugar\n  2 egg whites\n  3 egg yolks\n  50g espresso, cooled\n\n\n\n  \n    Place the egg yolks, 50g of sugar and coffee in a bowl and whisk over a pan of simmering water until thick and silky to create a sabayon. Mix in the chocolate and stir until melted. Take off the heat and set aside.\n  \n  \n    Quickly whip the cream until it forms soft peaks. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they also form soft peaks, then gradually add the remaining 25g of caster sugar whilst continuing to whisk vigorously, until fully incorporated. Set aside. Pour the chocolate sabayon into another bowl to cool it slightly (it should be around 35-40 C), then fold the cream in stages, mixing the first spoonful vigorously to stabilise the mixture so it doesn’t sieze. Once the cream is mixed in, gently fold the egg white mixture in.\n  \n  \n    Pour the mousse into moulds or dishes and leave in the fridge for a minimum of 6 hours to set.\n  \n\n\n",

        content: "\n\nI think it’s high time I put a recipe for duck up here. This bird is rich in taste, tender in texture and a deep red colour; winning attributes I’m sure you’ll agree. At work we have made duck confit, pan fried breast (cooked pink and moist), terrine and rillettes. I also made some duck ham at home which was delicious. Duck’s versatility speaks for itself; there are a myriad different ways to prepare it. The best thing about it though is the thick layer of insulating fat under it’s skin which keeps the animal warm in freezing cold weather. For chefs this is the most indispensable part of the animal; the fat melts during cooking, keeping the meat beautifully moist and succulent. Excess fat collects in the bottom of the roasting tray but should never be thrown away! This is essential for your confit. This method of cooking meat was originally used for preservation, a form of charcuterie. Meat that had been lightly cured, then slowly and gently cooked in it’s own fat was then left to cool, the fat setting around the meat, completely sealing it from any moisture or bacteria from the air. When left for 5-6 months in a cool larder, the flavours had matured, resulting in a true authentic confit. It is not essential to mature your confit for quite this long; a fantastic flavour is still achievable in a few days.\n\n\n\n  4 duck legs\n  about 400ml of duck fat\n  1 sprig  of thyme\n  1 bay leaf\n  5 black peppercorns\n  200g of salt\n  100g of sugar\n  1 blade of mace\n  1 clove\n  1 star anise\n\n\n\n  \n    Firstly, make your cure mix. This can be as simple as just salt and sugar (ratio 2:1) but you may add extra flavourings and spices if you wish. For mine I used 200g salt, 100g sugar, and a small handful of spices: cloves, star anise, cinnamon, juniper berries, all finely ground.\n  \n  \n    Lightly sprinkle some of the cure mix onto the duck legs and rub into the flesh and skin. Cover, and leave in the fridge for 8 hours or overnight. Set the oven to 150C, and thoroughly wash the salt off the duck legs. Place in a casserole tray and cover with the duck fat, ensuring that they are completely covered. Add the thyme, bay leaf and peppercorns. Place in the oven for 3-4 hours or until the meat is extremely tender and falling off the bone.\n  \n  \n    Remove from the oven, and allow to cool slightly, then carefully strip all the meat from the bone, being careful to discard any sinew or gristle. Place the meat in a bowl and work with a spoon until the meat is finely shredded. Now add a few tablespoons of the duck fat and continue to work the mixture. You should have a smooth, moist paste. Add enough duck fat until this consistency is achieved. Taste, and adjust the seasoning. Roll into a cylinder in cling film and place in the fridge to set. Serve with melba toast, chutney and salad.\n  \n\n\n",

        content: "\n\nI’ve been meaning to make a coq au vin for a while now. It’s a rustic French classic that is hard to beat as a crowd pleaser; a perfect marriage of ingredients that seem destined to accompany one another. Who could fail to adore this? Although these days it’s usually made with chicken (as I did), a traditional coq au vin is made with a mature cockerel. The meat from such a bird will be dark and rich in flavour compared to a young hen, but correspondingly tough as a result, meaning that it needs to be braised gently for a long time to make it tender. So I was looking forward to some tasty chicken slowly cooked in red wine… and to complete this classic dish, simply add small button mushrooms, baby pearl onions and some chunky dice of pancetta. Mmmm.\n\n\n\n  4 free range chicken legs, separated into drumsticks and thighs\n  850ml of red wine\n  1 sprig of thyme\n  1 bay leaf\n  1 stick of celery\n  1/2 leek\n  2 carrots\n  1 onion\n  2 cloves of garlic\n  20 buttom mushrooms\n  100g of pancetta, cut into 1cm cubes\n  12 baby pearl onions\n  some beurre manie\n  vegetable oil, for frying\n  sea salt and cracked black pepper\n\n\n\n  \n    Separate the thighs from the drumsticks and place in a suitably sized tub or ziplock bag. Crush the garlic, then chop the carrot, celery, onion, and leek into rough 1cm dice and add everything to the chicken along with the wine, thyme and bay leaf. Leave in the fridge to marinate for 1 day. Put the chicken breasts aside for another recipe. Make a simple stock with carcass; crush slightly and snugly fit it into a medium-small pot. Cover with cold water and slowly bring to the boil, skimming any scum that rises. Simmer gently for 3 hours, then strain and discard the bones. Reduce the stock by half, and place in the fridge until needed.\n  \n  \n    Heat the oven to 180C. Transfer the chicken and it’s marinade to a roasting tray, then bring to the boil on the stove top and simmer for 3 minutes to remove the alcohol. Place in the oven for about 45minutes, or until the meat is tender.\n  \n  \n    Meanwhile, heat a frying pan and cook the pancetta, onions and mushrooms over a high flame until nice and golden. Add the chicken stock to de-glaze, then simmer until the mushrooms and onions are just tender. Set aside.\n  \n  \n    When the chicken is cooked, remove from the tray and pat the skin dry with kitchen towel. Strain the braising liquid into a saucepan, and add the chicken stock poured off the from the mushrooms and shallots pan. Bring to the boil and reduce by about two thirds, until it is dark and rich. Season to taste, and thicken with a little beurre manie. While the sauce is reducing, crisp the chicken skin; in a frying pan heat some oil over a medium-low flame and brown the chicken, being careful not to burn it. The skin should be dark and caramelised. Serve with the mushrooms, shallots, pancetta and sauce poured over. Excellent with mashed potato or boiled new potatoes\n  \n\n\n",

        title: "Shepherd's Pie",
        category: "lamb",
        content: "\n\nHere’s another classic to add to the collection. It seems pretty appropriate that shepherd’s pie was a staple dish for us, at home on a sheep farm in rural Northumberland. I think this dish was traditionally made with left over meat from a roast dinner, but my Mum usually made it with our own lamb or mutton mince, which was a bit fattier than shop-bought mince and stronger in flavour; it was always really rich and filling. I’ve adapted the recipe here; instead of mince I’m using neck and slowly braising it on the bone. The neck is a pretty tough cut of meat so it needs cooking for a long time. It’s more flavoursome than the prime cuts, however, and absolutely worth the wait. Lamb neck is probably the tastiest part of the animal in my view, and very underrated. In the kitchen at work, we use veal stock as a base for most of our sauces; for something like this shepherd’s pie for example, we would make a rich jus from reduced veal stock to mix with the filling instead of gravy. The veal bones are slowly simmered in water for 2-3 days in order to extract maximum flavour and body from them. The gelatine extracted from the bones thickens the stock when it is reduced, so you get a naturally thick, rich jus without using flour. This is impractical to do at home, but you can get some way towards a proper jus when making a dish like this by cooking the meat on the bone, or adding extra bones to the braising liquid even. After reducing, the resulting sauce will be richer and have much more body to it.\n\n\n\n  3 lamb necks, cut in two\n  5 carrots\n  2 sticks of celery\n  1/2 bulb of garlic\n  1 sprig of thyme\n  1 sprig of rosemary\n  2 bay leaves\n  1 bottle of red wine\n  2kg of King Edward potatoes\n  50ml of whole milk\n  150g of unsalted butter, cut into small dice\n  1 leek\n  Wocester sauce\n  sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper\n  vegetable oil, for frying\n  olive oil\n\n\n\n  \n    Heat the oven to 160C. In a large deep roasting tray, lightly brown 2 of the carrots, the celery, garlic and onion all roughly chopped, in olive oil. Add the thyme, rosemary and bay leaves. Add a whole bottle of red wine and boil for 3 minutes to remove the alcohol.\n  \n  \n    Place a large, heavy based pan on a high flame and add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. When nice and hot, take the lamb necks and season all over with salt and pepper. Place the necks in the pan and fry until dark and caramelised all over. Now place the necks in the roasting tray with the wine and vegetables. Top up with water until all of the meat is just covered, bring to the boil, and wrap tightly with two layers of tin foil. Place in the oven for about 5 hours or until the meat is extremely tender and falling apart.\n  \n  \n    While the meat is cooking, make the mashed potato for the topping; this can be done in advance, even days before if necessary. Take the potatoes, prick each one several times with a knife and place in the oven with the lamb for 3 hours; the potatoes should be thoroughly cooked through. Remove from oven, cut in half and press the potato through a sieve into a wide-based saucepan. Now gradually add the butter whilst beating over a medium heat. The butter will emulsify into the dry, floury potato and give a luxurious silky texture. Add a splash of milk and mix thoroughly. Season generously with sea salt. Transfer into a container and set aside for later.\n  \n  \n    Remove the lamb necks and strain the braising liquid through a fine sieve into a saucepan. Bring to the boil and reduce until you have about 300ml of rich dark jus. Thicken with a little beurre manié until you have the consistency of a thin gravy. While the sauce is reducing, peel and cut the rest of the carrots into 5mm cubes, and pick the meat from the necks into rustic chunks. Fry the carrots in olive oil over a medium flame until lightly coloured. Cut the leek into 1cm squares and add to the pan. When the leeks are half-cooked, add the lamb and the sauce and gently fold, being careful not to break up the meat too much. Add a splash of Worcester sauce and season to taste with sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Pour the mixture into a baking dish and top with a thickness of about 1 inch of mashed potato. Place in the oven at 200C for about 20 minutes until golden on top\n  \n\n\n",

It was a firm favourite for us three at home especially for Rob who would devour mountains of it with lashings of tomato ketchup. We were so particular about the consistency of the sauce, being adamant that it had to be “nice and sloppy”. These days I like it a little thicker but still loose enough to be gooey and tempting, and with a nice golden gratin to give contrast in texture. One thing my parents did was to put slices of tomato on the top among the cheese. As a big fan of tomatoes, I would highly advise this. It gives a light freshness to balance the weight of all that cheese. The quality of a macaroni can be judged by the quality of it’s cheese sauce. My Dad taught me how to make perfectly smooth cheese sauce (or white sauce); he told me to add the milk to the roux in stages, and stir thoroughly each time to ensure that its totally smooth before adding more.

        content: "\n\nI often think that I’m very lucky to have grown up on a sheep farm, as I have a reliable supply of delicious organic lamb to create tasty delights with on a regular basis. I received a delivery of half a lamb a few weeks ago to replenish my supply. All of a sudden the drawers of the freezer were happily jammed and stuffed with shoulder, leg, neck and countless chops. If I was forced to choose I would probably have to pick lamb as my favourite meat, which may seem surprising given that throughout my childhood I was nurtured and brought up on it; far from being sick of it though, I think I have a greater appreciation of good quality meat from well raised animals. My home county, Northumberland, produces more lamb than any in Britain, and some of the most delicious lamb and mutton in the world is from there. I hate to see lamb from New Zealand on the supermarket shelves when we have much better tasting stuff right here on our doorstep. The tastiest I’ve ever had was from the farm back home, and I reckon this meat is the best to be found anywhere.This is from Raymond Blanc’s Kitchen Secrets, another reliable recipe which his mother, the legendary “Maman Blanc” would have made. Rustic home cooking. It’s lamb shoulder, slow-roasted to achieve a gorgeous melting texture, and with some bones and neck chops in the bottom of the pan along with wine and herbs creating an extremely flavoursome liquid to make the sauce with. For this I reduced the liquid slightly, thickened with some beurre manié and stirred in some finely chopped mint and a splash of white wine vinegar. I served the lamb with some leek and carrot, finely sliced to mirror the flakiness of the meat, and some roasted new potatoes.\n\n\n\n  1 1/2kg of lamb shoulder\n  1 sprig of thyme\n  1 sprig of rosemary\n  olive oil\n  sea salt and cracked black pepper\n  3 or 4 lamb neck chops, or 700g trimmings\n  1 bulb of garlic\n  100ml of dry white wine\n  1 bay leaf\n  some beurre manie\n\n\n\n  \n    Heat the oven to 230C.

Leave to marinate.\n  \n  \n    Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a roasting tray and fry lamb neck chops (or bones and trimmings) until light golden on each side, add bulb of garlic cut in half, brown for a few minutes then remove from heat.

Take the lamb out of the oven and add the wine mixture, scraping off any tasty sediment from the bottom of the tray. Baste the meat for a minute. Now turn the oven down to 150C, cover the meat loosely with foil and return to the oven. Roast for about 4 hours, basting every 30 minutes.

        title: "Rabbit Liver Parfait",
        category: "game",
        content: "\n\nFor years of my childhood I hated eating liver. One of our regular meals at home was a bacon and tomato pasta sauce which was finished with sautéed chicken livers. I would always baulk at the livers and have just the pasta sauce instead. The flavour has grown on me recently though and I actually love it now. Strange though I have always loved liver paté. Mum always made it at Christmas time, which we’d have on toast with chutney and salad for lunch; a really nice combination. She made it by frying the liver with bacon, adding some herbs, a splash of sherry and some cream then puréeing and leaving to set in a bowl. It was a favourite and always got finished quickly. When I was working at Blackmore’s I got introduced to chicken liver parfait. It’s a luxurious version of paté that is enriched with eggs and butter. All the ingredients are blitzed together raw, poured into a mould and cooked very gently so that the finished article is still beautifully pink. It’s really fantastic, and easily the best way to treat livers in my opinion. My brother recently acquired 18 wild rabbits from the farm at home, brought them up to Edinburgh and put them in his freezer. I went over to his house today and got a couple to make something tasty with. I also picked up all of the livers from the rabbits which he had set aside. Rabbit liver parfait! Rabbit liver has a similar consistency to chicken liver but tastes miles better. It would be perfect to make parfait with. I couldn’t find any recipes for rabbit parfait so I have used Raymond Blanc’s recipe for chicken liver parfait and adapted it slightly. I cooked it in a water bath in a cool oven to ensure that the heat transfer is gentle and we end up with a lovely pink colour. To execute this recipe properly, you will need a temperature probe, otherwise determining when the parfait is done is pretty much guess work. Because liver parfait is so rich, it needs to be garnished appropriately. Pickle or chutney is great as it has an acidic kick of vinegar which cuts through the meaty savouriness. Add some salad leaves for freshness and you have an excellent dish. Served on toast, or with delicate melba toast as I did, and you have a luxurious and delicious platter for your lunch.\n\n\n\n  400g of rabbit livers\n  500ml of whole milk\n  100ml of port\n  100ml of madeira\n  70g of shallots, finely sliced\n  2 sprigs of thyme\n  1 clove of garlic\n  60g of brandy\n  400g of unsalted butter\n  2 whole eggs\n  2 egg yolks\n  sea salt\n  ground white pepper\n\n\n\n  \n    Take the livers and trim them of all sinew. Rinse several times with water, then soak in milk for 1 hour. This draws out the blood which would cause the parfait to be bitter. Meanwhile, place in a pan the port, madeira, shallots, thyme, garlic and brandy. Bring to the boil then reduce to a syrup. Set aside and leave to cool to room temperature. Carefully heat the butter so that it is melted but at room temperature. Blend the livers until smooth with the eggs and egg yolks. With the blender still running, gradually add the butter. Once everything is combined, season to taste with salt and black pepper, then pass the mixture through a fine sieve. Pour into a terrine mould or loaf tin lined with cling film, with enough cling film spare to wrap over the top. Alternatively you could pour it into small ramekins\n  \n  \n    Pre-heat the oven to 120C. Get a roasting tin and place a folded tea towel in the bottom, this will help stop the terrine mould from sliding when placing into the oven. Put the terrine mould in and pour boiling water around to reach two-thirds of the way up, then place into the oven until the centre reaches 62C. It should take around 30 minutes but keep checking and measuring the temperature often with the probe.\n  \n  \n    Remove from the oven and place straight into the fridge to cool. Leave for several hours, preferably a whole day. To serve, cut thick slices and trim of any discoloured bits from around the edge. The parfait should be uniformly pink.\n  \n\n\n",

We came upon an Italian restaurant on the edge of the beach, with plastic tables and chairs arranged under palm trees. Reputedly the pizzas and pasta were particularly good so we thought we’d give it a go. I went for ‘tomato and prawn spaghetti’ and it was absolutely delicious. It was a simple dish, using fresh tomatoes and little baby prawns. It had a really nice light sauce and was the perfect thing to eat on a hot evening, accompanied by a chilled bottle of beer! So this is my attempt at replicating that dish. It’s basically a sauce made from tomato juice, white wine and garlic, then thickened and enriched with butter. The diced tomato flesh and prawns are then simply added to heat through, just before serving. I used frozen cooked baby prawns, but if you can find fresh ones then all the better. It’s seasonal too; tomatoes are just about still good at this time of year, so make the most of it!\n\n\n\n  3 tomatoes\n  200g of spaghetti\n  1 clove of garlic\n  30g of unsalted butter\n  180g of cooked prawns\n  1 handful of fresh basil leaves\n  sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper\n  extra virgin olive oil\n  200ml of white wine\n\n\n\n  \n    Get a pan of salted boiling water on the go; this will be for blanching the tomatoes and cooking the spaghetti. To peel the tomatoes: carefully cut out the stalk with the tip of a small knife and score a cross in the bottom. Get a large bowl of very cold water ready, drop the tomatoes in the boiling water for 15 seconds, then remove and place straight into the cold water.\n  \n  \n    Once the water has come back to the boil, add a glug of olive oil, put in the spaghetti and cook according to the packet instructions. Peel the tomatoes, discard the skin then quarter, de-seed (reserving the pulp and seeds) and cut the flesh into small dice. Set aside the dice (this is called tomato concasse).Take the pulp and seeds, blitz in a blender and pass through a fine sieve into a saucepan.\n  \n  \n    Heat another saucepan over a medium heat, and add a glug of olive oil. Add the garlic and saute gently for 30 seconds. and add the wine. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk in the butter cut into small dice piece by piece, being sure to emulsify properly. Add the tomato concasse, prawns and basil. Add the spaghetti and mix everything together, making sure the pasta is nicely coated with the sauce. Taste and season with salt and freshly pepper.

        title: "Granny's Spelt Bread",
        category: "bread",
        content: "\n\nMy granny lives on a farm on the west coast of Scotland near Oban, right by the sea where it’s windswept and wild. The best bit about going to visit is that you get treated to her home-made bread. She makes beautiful wholegrain rolls with seeds in and treacle to make them extra dark, rich and malty. They’re the tastiest, nourishing things you could imagine. She used to make them with normal wheat flour, but in recent years she found that she has an intolerance to wheat gluten so she uses spelt flour now instead. Spelt is brilliant. It’s an ancestor of wheat that has been used for around 9000 years. It was an important crop in the development of civilisation because it thrived in poor growing conditions and was particularly resistant to disease and pests due the tough outer husk surrounding the grain. More recently it’s become redundant as preference has moved to higher-yielding varieties of wheat that are better suited to the commercial bread industry. You can still can buy spelt from some health food shops and delicatessens, which is good news because it’s absolutely delicious. As well as making bread with the flour you can make excellent risotto from whole spelt grains, as they do in a number of restaurants now. My granny doesn’t knead the dough at all, which gives a pleasing rustic consistency to the bread. She also uses fairly hot water to activate the yeast; the water shouldn’t be too hot, as this would kill the yeast, but just hand-hot (about 45C). This relatively high temperature causes the bread to rise quickly, resulting in lots of little air pockets. Her technique for baking the bread is to simply bake all of the dough into one large flat loaf, then cut it up into roll-sized portions once it has cooled. If you prefer, you could shape into individual rolls and bake them separately.\n\n\n\n  1kg of wholegrain spelt flour\n  1 teaspoon of salt\n  1 tablespoon of dried yeast\n  1 handful of sunflower seeds\n  1 handful of pumpkin seeds\n  1 handful of pine nuts\n  1 litre of water, hand-hot\n  2 tablespoons of black treacle\n  2 tablespoons of olive oil\n\n\n\n  Heat the oven to 200C. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, yeast, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and pine nuts. In a jug, mix the water with olive oil and treacle. Mix the contents of the jug into the bowl with the flour, cover and leave in a warm place to rise for 20 minutes. Line a large roasting tin with greaseproof paper and scrape the dough into it. Leave in a warm place to rise again for 10 minutes, then place in the oven for 20-30 minutes, until nice and brown on the top and sounding hollow when tapped underneath.

Tony, one of the Wedgwood chefs, suggested sprinkling on some toasted crushed peanuts at the end to create extra crunch, which I thought was a great idea. I decided to use salted peanuts, as the peanut butter contains salt anyway and it gives a nice contrast to the sweet cream and jam.\n\n\n\n  300g of strawberry jam\n  1 handful of salted peanuts\n  200ml of double cream\n  200ml of milk\n  120g of peanut butter\n  5 egg yolks\n  50g of caster sugar\n\n\n\n  \n    Heat the strawberry jam until it melts. Strain through a fine sieve then pour into the bottom of 6 or 7 ramekins, depending on their size. Place in the fridge to set. Crush the peanuts into small crumbs and toast in a frying pan until golden. Set aside. Put the cream, milk and peanut butter into a saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring with a whisk to incorporate. Set aside.\n  \n  \n    Place the eggs and caster sugar in a metal bowl, and whisk over a pan of simmering water until it forms ribbons when lifted up. Pour the peanut butter cream onto the egg mix, continuing to whisk. Heat the mixture on the pan of simmering water, stirring constantly to prevent it sticking. Thicken again until it makes thick ribbons when you lift the whisk up. When your pour the mixture into the ramekins it should be thick enough that it only just levels out. Place in the fridge for several hours to set.\n  \n  \n    When fully chilled, sprinkle a thin layer of sugar over and caramelize with a blowtorch. Quickly sprinkle some toasted peanuts over before the sugar has cooled, so they set into the caramel.\n  \n\n\n",

        title: "Peanut Butter Caramel Shortbread",
        category: "dessert",
        content: "\n\nMy mum makes excellent millionaire shortbread. It’s a treat when she comes to visit because I always get a tin full of lovely caramely chocolatey shortbread squares. On a daily basis I’ll come home from work and, hungry, peruse the fridge for something to eat. The tin of shortbread generally gets raided whilst I’m deciding what to make for my dinner…just one piece usually ends up being two or three; needless to say the millionaire shortbread supply never lasts long! Since peanut butter and chocolate is already established as a good flavour combination it was just a small logical step to make peanut butter millionaire shortbread. I’ve been doing blog posts on Scottish ingredients and recipes, and shortbread is definitely a Scottish thing so I suppose at a stretch this is a Scottish recipe. On flicking through my recipe books, I picked up some tips on how to make shortbread. Although simple, it’s important to make it carefully so as not to end up with a poor result. When mixing the ingredients it’s vital to not overwork as the butter will begin to melt; then when it cooks it’ll be hard instead of the soft, melt-in-the-mouth consistency you’re looking for. Marcus Wareing suggests finely grating the chilled butter when making shortbread, then you hardly have to work the mixture with your hands and the butter barely softens at all. The result is excellent.\n\n\n\n  270g of plain flour\n  80g of caster sugar\n  220g of unsalted butter\n  150g of condensed milk\n  50g of golden syrup\n  150g of smooth peanut butter\n  200g of milk chocolate, or dark chocolate\n\n\n\n  \n    First make the shortbread: in a large mixing bowl, place 270g flour, 80g caster sugar, a pinch of salt and 180g of chilled and finely grated unsalted butter. Lightly rub the mixture together with your hands until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Line a 20cm x 30cm baking tray with greaseproof paper and press the shortbread mixture into it. Place in the fridge for about an hour. Preheat the oven to 160C and bake for 40mins or until light golden in colour. Remove from the oven, prick all over with a fork and leave on a rack to cool.\n  \n  \n    When the shortbread is completely cool, make the peanut butter caramel: place 150g condensed milk, 40g unsalted butter, 50g of golden syrup and 150g of smooth peanut butter in a saucepan over a low heat and stir until melted and thoroughly incorporated. Simmer for 5 minutes whilst stirring constantly with a spatula; this thickens the caramel making it set firm when cooled. Pour onto the shortbread and spread evenly. Put in a cool place to set. To finish, melt 200g of milk or dark chocolate and pour over the caramel shortbread once it has cooled. Leave again to cool, then cut into squares.\n  \n\n\n",

        content: "\n\nI had some leftover raspberry puree from when I made the chocolate and raspberry brownies, so I decided to turn it into cordial. My mum makes blackcurrant cordial from hoards of blackcurrant bushes we have back home and it’s fantastic. She puts it in empty Ribena bottles and it’s indistinguishable from the genuine article! I’ve always loved Ribena, and although blackcurrant cordial is quite readily available I’ve never come across a raspberry version. So here it is; the sweet taste of summer in a bottle. A basic fruit cordial consists of fruit, sugar and water. My first attempt was simply to make a sugar syrup, add the raspberry puree and bring to the boil. The result was excellent, yielding a really fresh raspberry flavour. When I subsequently did some research online, I found that most of the recipes for fruit cordial involved heating the sugar water and fruit together and simmering for 10 minutes or so before allowing to cool and bottling. I tried a second batch using this method, also adding some lemon juice and peel for a extra dimension in flavour, and although the flavour was good it was not as fresh as the first method which didn’t involve cooking the fruit for as long. In addition I think it tasted better without the lemon; I believe the amazing flavour of fresh raspberries should be allowed to shine without hindrance. This is simple, unadorned raspberry flavour!\n\n\n\n  550g of raspberries\n  400ml of water\n  350g of caster sugar\n\n\n\n  Puree raspberries by placing them in a blender, blitzing until smooth then passing through a fine sieve to remove the seeds.

Turn off the heat, and skim off any scum that has risen to the surface. Pass once more through a fine sieve, allow to cool, then store in sterilised bottles.\n\n\n",

Now settled in and enjoying the comforts of a nice flat with a better equipped kitchen than the last one (the kitchen is, after all, the most important room in any house) I am set to get blogging again. I’m very aware that there’s a lack of sweet things on this blog. I must make amends. Also, I had an idea to do a series of recipes involving quintessential Scottish ingredients…such as raspberries! This is a replication of the brownies that Marc made at Wedgwood last week; I used Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall’s basic brownie recipe as a basis. For chocoholics this is a truly indulgent affair, and combined with a gorge of fresh summer fruit in the form of juicy raspberries it’s brilliant. A fantastic marriage of flavours. The brownie should be shiny and cracked on top, hiding the heavenly soft centre which any brownie lover craves.\n\n\n\n  150g of Scottish raspberries\n  icing sugar, to taste\n  170g of butter\n  200g of caster sugar\n  100g of light brown muscovado sugar\n  3 whole eggs\n  1 teaspoon of vanilla extract\n  100g of cocoa powder\n  50g of plain flour\n\n\n\n  \n    Heat the oven to 160C/Gas 3. Grease a 22x22x5cm brownie tin and line with two strips of baking parchment, letting the sides hang over the edge to make removing the brownies easier. Firstly, prepare the raspberries: place the raspberries in a blender and puree. Sweeten to taste with icing sugar. Pass the mixture through a sieve to remove the seeds. Set aside.\n  \n  \n    Place the butter in a saucepan and melt over a medium heat until it turns brown and develops a nutty aroma. Set aside to cool. Using an electric hand mixer, beat together the caster sugar, light muscovado sugar and eggs until thick and glossy. The ribbon of batter should be visible on the surface for several seconds when you lift up the whisk. Beat in the vanilla extract and the browned butter. Sift the cocoa powder and plain flour into a separate bowl. Gently fold this into the egg mixture with a spatula. Scrape about half of the mixture into the prepared tin, then spoon dollops of the raspberry puree on top. Scrape the rest of the brownie mix on top, and stir the mixture slightly to create a marble effect. Place in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out of the middle of the brownies with a few moist crumbs attached.\n  \n\n\n",

        content: "\n\nI haven’t got one single post about fish on this blog yet, which is a shame because I’ve been living in Edinburgh for a while now and, being in Scotland and situated right next to the sea, it’s obviously a great place for eating seafood. I admit that I’m a bit of a novice when it comes to fish as I don’t often cook it, although I do love eating it. I recently invested in a copy of the River Cottage Fish Book which has provided a good bit of inspiration. Flicking through it the other day, a photo of salmon tartare grabbed my attention. Since making steak tartare recently and appreciating it’s beautiful simplicity, salmon tartare obviously appealed to me. Steak tartare is a celebration of well-aged, tender beef that is full of flavour. Salmon tartare is much the same: the piece of fish used must be top quality and as fresh as possible. Finding such a piece of fish was not going to be a problem in Edinburgh, and was particularly easy for me asArmstrong’s fishmongers, recognized by many as the best in the city, happens to be just down the road from my flat. “All of this was fresh this morning” he assured me when I told him I needed a piece of salmon as fresh as possible. On slicing it was clearly very fresh, the orange-pink flesh glossy and firm. Tasting it as it was, pure and unadorned, it already had excellent flavour. Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall uses Tabasco and Worcester sauce in his recipe which I chose to omit here as I think the amazing flavour of the fish shouldn’t be masked too much by additives. My version of the dish, I believe, includes enough extra ingredients to compliment and enhance the natural flavour of the fish without overpowering it. One of my favourite things about this dish is the magic worked by the lemon juice. As well as imparting sharp fresh flavour, the acid in the lemon juice affects the protein in the fish, causing a “cooked” texture on the surface of the meat. The acid denatures the protein molecules just as heat does when cooking, and as the brine did in my pig’s cheeks recipe. Pickling things in vinegar, again, has the same denaturing effect. All of these in a sense are just different ways of cooking meat. The advantage of using a method like this is that the fresh flavour of the raw meat does not change nearly as much as if you cooked it. The salmon will continue to “cook” for as long as it is left to marinate in the lemon juice. I would recommend no more than 5 minutes; this will result in a fairly thin layer of cooked-texture meat surrounding a lovely soft rare centre.\n\n\n\n  1 teaspoon of shallots, finely chopped\n  1 teaspoon of parsley, finely chopped\n  1 teaspoon of chives, finely chopped\n  1 teaspoon of gherkins, finely chopped\n  1 teaspoon of lemon juice, freshly squeezed\n  sea salt\n  freshly cracked black pepper\n\n\n\n  Remove the skin from the salmon and cut out the grey coloured blood line so you have only the shiny pink flesh. Cut into approximate 1cm dice and place in a bowl. Add shallots, parsley, chives, gherkins and lemon juice, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Mix well, taste and adjust the quantities and seasoning if need be. There are no exact quantities for this, just experiment and find out what works best for you. Leave to\n\n\n",

It’s a proper hearty winter warmer of a dish, and pretty much a meal in itself as it is so thick and substantial. I made this soup with meat from the braised breast and stock that I made from the mutton bones. You could instead use leftover meat from a mutton or lamb roast, along with chicken stock from powder if you don’t want to make stock from scratch. The mutton could also be substituted quite satisfactorily with chicken; get some chicken thighs, season and toss in olive oil and roast on gas mark 7 for about 30 minutes. Then just pick off the meat and substitute into the recipe below accordingly. I used braised breast, but you could just as well use another cut such as scruffy chops, belly or neck chops. If you do braise some meat, you could use the braising liquor instead of making stock, although it will taste quite strongly of wine (if you use my recipe below) which you may not want in the soup. I believe the rich mellow flavour obtained from the slowly cooked stock is preferable in this case.\n\n\n\n  150g of streaky bacon\n  1 onion\n  2 sticks of celery\n  3 large cloves of garlic\n  1/2 teaspoon of mutton fat, reserved from the stock\n  2 carrots, cut into 5mm dice\n  300g of braised mutton, cut into bitesized pieces\n  1 1/2 teaspoon of madras curry powder\n  1/4 teaspoon of paprika\n  1 litre of mutton stock\n  sea salt and cracked black pepper\n  a few drops of worcester sauce\n  1 teaspoon  of white wine vinegar\n  1 handful of flat leaf parsley\n  300g of potatoes, cut into 1cm dice\n\n\n\n  Cut the bacon into thin lardons and fry in a little olive oil in a large pot until just starting to colour.

Dinner consisted of as many pancakes as you could possibly eat, accompanied by a variety of fillings. The most popular, and an all-time classic was sugar and lemon juice. Simple and delicious; hard to beat. Other household favourites were bolognese sauce; maple syrup; and – I think it deserves a mention, although I realise that this will cause severe discontent among some – Marmite. “Crazy talk!” I hear you say, but if you (like me) are not a hater but a lover, put some Marmite on your pancake along with some butter, it’s fantastic. The final addition to my list of classic and favourite fillings is a relatively new one for me. My friend Richard, a fellow pancake obsessive, is an advocate for butter and sugar being the all-time best pancake filler. I was surprised that I had never before thought of this combination, they are two ingredients that almost everyone is bound to have in their house, and it’s a winner. So if you make pancakes you must try it. Make sure you use plenty of butter; fry the pancake in butter and put more butter on after flipping and before adding plenty of granulated sugar. Sweet buttery goodness. Lovely.Today I decided to have a break from tradition and try some new fillings. I found in my fridge some smoked salmon, crème fraîche and spinach… I waved my magic wand and very soon I had two delicious pancake fillings ready to be married in tasty happiness to some beautiful crêpes.\n\n\n\n  3 eggs\n  250g of plain flour\n  450ml of whole milk\n  1 pinch of salt\n\n\n\n  Crack the eggs into a bowl, add the flour, a splash of milk and salt.

Let the batter stand for 2 hours before cooking; this allows any air in the mixture to dissipate, ensuring that the pancakes do not rise when cooking and stay nice and flat. Thin the batter just before cooking with 50-100ml of milk. To cook the pancakes, get your frying pan nice and hot before adding a knob of butter. Once the butter has melted, pour in a small amount of batter whilst carefully tilting the pan to ensure that a nice thin even spread is achieved. Fry for a few minutes on each side, until nice and golden.\n\n\n",

        content: "\n\nThis has long been a staple dish in my repertoire and I think that I, like many of us, have a weakness for a good meaty pasta sauce. However, bolognese sauce can often turn out mediocre if thrown together in a hurry and without much thought. My philosophy for making a good bolognese rests on two principles. One: it should be really meaty, and two: it should simmer gently for a long time to tenderise the meat. My usual bolognese contains beef mince, pork mince, bacon, and pork sausage meat. This gives a nice combination of meaty flavours. It’s nice to vary things though, and I sometimes combine the beef mince with lamb or venison mince. Another thing about my bolognese, which is slightly controversial, is that I omit tomatoes and only include tomato puree. The main liquid component of the sauce instead comes from beef or pork stock, which promotes a richer meat flavour. This is an easy reliable meal, and a great one to serve if you have guests since just about everyone likes spaghetti bolognese! I usually make a big quantity, then freeze most of it before adding the cream.\n\n\n\n  150g of streaky bacon\n  2 onions\n  3 large  cloves of garlic\n  1 stick of celery\n  2 carrots\n  500g of beef mince\n  500g of pork mince\n  250g of good quality sausage meat\n  5 tablespoons of tomato puree\n  200ml of white wine\n  300ml of beef stock\n  sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper\n  1 sprig of thyme\n  1 bay leaf\n  3 tablespoons of double cream\n  vegetable oil, for frying\n  parmesan cheese, to serve\n  600g of spaghetti\n\n\n\n  Chop the bacon into small lardons and fry in a couple of tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan. Meanwhile, peel and finely dice onions, garlic and celery. Add to pan with the bacon just as it is starting to colour. Turn the heat down and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes, until the onions are soft and translucent. Peel and chop the carrots into small dice and add to the pan. Cook for a further 5 minutes. Now add the rest of the meat and turn the heat up; stir constantly until all the meat is browned and well mixed. Add the tomato puree, wine and stock, along with a good pinch of cracked black pepper, the thyme and bay leaf. Bring to the boil, then leave barely simmering, uncovered, for about 2 hours, or until the mince is very tender and the sauce is intense and rich. If need be, add more stock if the sauce is looking too dry. Taste, and season. Just before serving, stir in the double cream. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese and a nice big fresh salad.\n\n\n",

        title: "Dry Cured Bacon",
        category: "pork",
        content: "\n\nSince my last batch of dry cure bacon had been finished up a while ago, it was high time I made some more. Although I was pleased with the last lot, I was slightly annoyed by the fact I had to soak it in water to reduce the saltiness, as the flavour from the rosemary, sugar and black peppercorns will have also been reduced. Whilst browsing the River Cottage forums one day, I read about other people who had had the same problem when following Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall’s recipe for dry cure bacon. There was one person, Howard, who had done alot of research and looked at several different recipes before he tried curing his bacon, and said it turned out beautifully. So I decided to follow his guidelines. I love making bacon. Such a simple procedure, with such amazing results. It’s quite comforting to have a load of delicious streaky bacon sitting in my fridge, waiting to be turned into something tasty. Again, I got a hold of a whole pork belly (I don’t like to do things by half), but it wasn’t all for me; the other chefs Marc, Marcus and Alan from work were going to split the cost with me for a piece of bacony loveliness. I was more adventurous with the flavourings this time; nutmeg and rosemary were the primary notes, with undertones from a few other spices also coming through. I did actually end up soaking the bacon, but only for 1 hour this time, so the extra flavours were still noticeable in the finished bacon. I didn’t manage to get a hold of any salt petre unfortunately, so the bacon won’t keep its pinkness when cooked. The flavour will be unaffected though, which is the main thing. I’m very happy with the end product; I have delicious things in store for it. It was a source of comfort and joy to have my bacon hanging up in the kitchen, slowly maturing and increasing in firmness and flavour. Everyone should try making bacon, it’s so easy, and you will have a product which is many miles better than anything you can get in a supermarket.\n\n\n\n  5kg of pork belly\n  300g of salt\n  100g of soft brown sugar\n  1 tablespoon of cracked black pepper\n  6 bay leaves, finely chopped\n  3 sprigs of rosemary, finely chopped\n  1/2 teaspoons of ground mace\n  6 allspice berries, ground\n  3 cloves, ground\n\n\n\n  Mix all the ingredients except the pork together in a bowl. Rub about three-quarters of the mix into the belly, leave in the fridge for 24 hours then pour the liquid away and repeat, but only adding a small amount of cure mix after the first day. Cure it for 4 days, then cut off a piece and fry it to test for saltiness. If it’s too salty, just soak it under running water for an hour or longer to reduce this. Finally, wrap it in muslin and hang for a week in a cool larder to dry and allow the flavour to mature.\n\n\n",

It exemplifies everything great about Italian cuisine – simple, quick and with an emphasis on quality ingredients. It can be deceptively tricky to perfect however; too much heat when adding the eggs can result in scrambling them instead of gently cooking them to get the desired silky smooth sauce. My favourite way to have this meal is to make the sauce fairly runny, so that a lovely gooey creamy sauce collects at the bottom of your bowl. Each forkfull can then be stirred through this sauce to get it well coated before shoving it in your mouth with gusto, licking your lips and greedily going for another mouthful.

Add the pasta to the pan with the bacon and stir briefly (this helps to cool everything down slightly to avoid scrambling the eggs).\n  \n  \n    Now pour in the egg-cream mixture and mix everything together thouroughly. The residual heat from the pasta and bacon will gently cook the eggs and melt the cheese, resulting in an amazingly rich creamy sauce.

    "content": "<p><img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/chicken_and_coriander_broth.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>I was clearing out my fridge a few weeks ago and came across a selection of root vegetables lurking there, waiting to be turned into something tasty. The first thing that came to my mind was soup, and since we were in the middle of winter I was thinking along the lines of a chunky, meaty broth. I decided on Chicken, which would provide my soup with both the chunky meat component and the stock. A bunch of fresh coriander which also happened to be in my fridge could be involved here in some way, I thought. I remembered a Madhur Jaffrey recipe for coriander chicken curry, involving large quantities of fresh coriander, resulting in a vibrant green curry sauce. It was fantastic, and so I reckoned it could work in my soup too. The earthiness of all those root vegetables would be balanced by the fresh zing of the coriander, perhaps. I prepared the chicken in my usual way; removed the breasts, then cut up the remaining carcass into small pieces and fried until nicely caramelised for the stock. This time I actually chopped up the wings and legs too and added them to the stock for extra flavour. Once the stock was almost ready, after an hour or so, I took some out to gently poach the breast meat in a separate pan. Once perfectly barely cooked, I allowed them to cool before carefully cutting them into dice. All the vegetables and chicken diced to the same size, making for an attractive looking bowl of broth.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>1 free range chicken</li>\n  <li>1 carrot</li>\n  <li>1 onion</li>\n  <li>1 stick of celery</li>\n  <li>1/2 leek</li>\n  <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>\n  <li>1 teaspoon of coriander seeds, crushed</li>\n  <li>5 black peppercorns</li>\n  <li>150ml of dry sherry</li>\n  <li>150ml of red wine</li>\n  <li>75g of unsalted butter</li>\n  <li>chicken breasts</li>\n  <li>150g of carrot</li>\n  <li>150g of swede</li>\n  <li>150g of celeriac</li>\n  <li>1 onion</li>\n  <li>2 large cloves of garlic</li>\n  <li>1 large bunch of coriander</li>\n  <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Remove the breasts from the chicken and set aside. Chop the remaining carcass, including the legs and wings, into small pieces. Cut all the vegetables into approx. 1cm dice, set aside. Get a large heavy based pan on a high heat and colour the bones in 2 batches until golden and caramelised. Add a knob of butter at the end of each batch and foam for a few minutes, to enrich and brown the bones further, then drain the butter off in a colander. Add the vegetables, the garlic, coriander seeds and peppercorns to the same pan, which should have some dark intense residue stuck to the bottom, and sweat gently for about 15- 20 minutes, until soft and sweet. All the tasty chicken residue should have melted into the vegetables. Put the chicken bones back into the pan, and add the sherry and red wine. Reduce the alcohol until completely dry, then cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, skimming any fat and scum that rises. Simmer gently for 2 hours, skimming frequently. Pass through a fine sieve and set aside.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>When the stock is almost ready, ladle some out into a small pan and gently poach the chicken breasts, just covered with hot stock but not boiling, turning the breasts every few minutes. Remove when they are just barely cooked, and allow to cool. While the stock is cooking, prepare the vegetables for the broth: cut the carrot, celeriac, swede and onion into 5mm dice, and finely chop the garlic. Sweat the onion and garlic in vegetable oil for about 5 minutes, until soft. Add the carrot and cook for about 5 minutes, add the swede and cook for a further 2 minutes, then finally add the celeriac. Sweat until all the veg is nicely cooked, then remove from the heat. Cut the cooked chicken breast into 5mm dice and set aside. When the stock is ready, season to taste with salt and pour just enough over the diced vegetables, ensuring to leave it nice and thick. You may have some leftover. Add the chicken dice and gently warm through. Finally chop the coriander and stir through at the very end.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n",

There are two things I generally prefer to do with a pork belly; either salt it and cure it to make dry-cured bacon, or braise it long and slow, for about 12 hours, then press and chill it before roasting it until crispy. Pork belly cooked this way has the most amazing mouthfeel; the meat itself is succulent and has fat running through the layers that melts in your mouth, and the skin that sits atop is the most fantastic crisp pork crackling. It’s a great contrast of textures!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>1 1/2kg of pork belly, skin on, bones removed but reserved</li>\n  <li>200g of pork trimmings, diced</li>\n  <li>2 rashers of smoked streaky bacon, diced</li>\n  <li>2 sprigs of thyme</li>\n  <li>fine sea salt, or table salt</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of sage</li>\n  <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>400ml of medium dark ale</li>\n  <li>1 carrot</li>\n  <li>1/2 leek</li>\n  <li>1 onion</li>\n  <li>1 tomato</li>\n  <li>1/2 bulb of garlic</li>\n  <li>1 litre of chicken stock, unseasoned</li>\n  <li>20g of unsalted butter</li>\n  <li>a little beurre manie</li>\n  <li>1 spring cabbage</li>\n  <li>200g of baby spinach</li>\n  <li>20 spears of medium asparagus, points removed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 140C. To cook the pork belly, season it with 1 heaped teaspoon of fine salt and rub it into the flesh and skin side. Line a roasting tray that just fits it in snugly with greaseproof paper, and add water until just covered. Add a sprig of thyme and a few sage leaves, then place in the oven for 10-12 hours, until it is absolutely tender and almost falling apart when touching it with a spoon. Remove the liquid from the tray, and set aside. Now cover the belly with another sheet of greaseproof paper and press with another tray on top, followed by a heavy weight (2-3kg). Place in the fridge to chill for at least 6 hours.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>To make the pork and ale sauce; take the reserved bones from the belly and cut into small pieces using a cleaver or a heavy pair of scissors. Cut the carrot, leek, onion and tomato into approx 1cm dice, and set aside. Lightly crush the garlic. In a large, heavy based pan, heat about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over a high heat. Saute the bones until golden, then strain in a colander. Reduce the heat to medium, and in the same pan, cook the vegetables with a generous pinch of salt for about 10 minutes. Add the pork bones back in, along with the rest of the thyme and a few sage leaves. Add the ale, and bring to the boil. Reduce until the liquid is completely gone, then add the reserved cooking liquid from the pork belly. Bring to the boil, and reduce until dry again. Add enough chicken stock until just covered, then simmer gently for 30 minutes. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve, and reduce by half, or until you have an intense flavour. Whisk in some beurre manie to thicken, adding just a little bit at a time. Set the sauce aside.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 180C. Portion the pork belly into 4 equal sized pieces, and score the skin carefully in a criss-cross pattern. Add 3-4 tablespoons of vegetable oil to a large heavy based pan (with an oven-proof handle), then add the pork skin side down and place over a high heat. When it just starts to sizzle, place in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the skin is golden and very crispy.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>While the pork belly is cooking, prepare the vegetables; fill a large pot with water and season generously with salt. Bring to the boil. Cut off the bottom 1-2 cm of the asparagus as it is woody and tough. Remove the outer 2 or 3 layers of the cabbage, and cut out the thick veins. Slice coarsely. Wash the baby spinach leaves, then set aside. When the pork belly is about 5 minutes away from finished, heat the butter in a large saute pan until foaming, then add the cabbage along with a pinch of salt. Cook until tender. Cook the asparagus in the boiling salted water until just tender - about 4 minutes. Finally, add the baby spinach to the pan with the cabbage and cook until wilted. Serve the pork belly on the bed of vegetables, and pour the sauce over.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n",

When I’m working all day I can have my dinner slowly cooking for when I get back. I make tomato sauce with the slow cooker; tinned tomatoes, onion, garlic, and tomato puree simmered gently for several hours until it is dark and reduced. I then puree and pass it through a fine sieve to make it extra smooth. What you get is an amazingly rich dark red sauce. This can be used for any number of things, but my current favourite is to make salty pungent puttanesca with it. This sauce is accompanied by spaghetti; literally “whore’s style spaghetti”, it’s packed with in-your-face flavours. Traditionally made with tomatoes, garlic, black olives, anchovies and capers, it’s salty and more-ish. It’s a good dish to have in your repertoire; because it’s made almost entirely with store cupboard ingredients it can be rustled up with just a moment’s notice, although in my recipe the tomato sauce is simmered for eight hours to make it extra rich. This isn’t essential but will make your sauce taste amazing. I recommend making a big batch of sauce and freezing it. As there are so many big and bold flavours going on here, I have added a good handful of parsley and basil to bring some freshness to the dish and vital splash of green, making it particularly eye-catching.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>2 400g tins of peeled plum tomatoes</li>\n  <li>3 tablespoons of tomato puree</li>\n  <li>1 onion</li>\n  <li>5 large cloves of garlic</li>\n  <li>1 glass of red wine</li>\n  <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>\n  <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>\n  <li>1 large handful of pitted black olives</li>\n  <li>6 anchovy fillets</li>\n  <li>1 large bunch of flat leaf parsley</li>\n  <li>1 handful  of basil leaves</li>\n  <li>400g of tagliatelle</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>To make the tomato sauce; finely slice the onion and sweat in a couple of glugs of olive oil with a generous pinch of salt until the onions are completely softened. Now finely chop the garlic cloves and add to the pot along with the tomatoes, tomato puree, sugar and red wine. Bring to the boil, then gently simmer for about 8 hours until the sauce is rich and dark. Puree the sauce in a blender and pass through a fine sieve. it should be fairly thick so that it coats the pasta nicely. If it’s too thin, simmer it gently to reduce further. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Cook your pasta according to the packet instructions while you finish the sauce: finely chop the anchovy fillets and gently fry in a little olive oil until they start to disintegrate, then add the tomato sauce and stir. Slice the olives and add to the sauce. Finely chop the parsley and roughly chop the basil and add to the sauce at the very end. When the pasta is ready, stir the sauce in; add just enough to coat the pasta nicely, it should be really thick. Serve with some red wine and crusy bread. Fantastic!</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n",

The process of salting and smoking fish was originally a method of preserving the fish to enable long storage. Although not necessary as a means of survival anymore, smoked fish - salmon and haddock in particular - is commonly enjoyed all over the country because it’s simply delicious! I recently had great pleasure in making Cullen Skink - the traditional Scottish soup made with smoked haddock - but since it has been so warm recently I wanted to do something a bit less hearty and filling. Some sort of salad seemed like the best thing to do, so I just warmed the fish gently in some milk, and flaked it over a simple salad of baby spinach, spring onions and courgette sliced thinly into ribbons.

Season with sea salt and olive oil, then add to the bowl of salad.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Carefully poach the eggs until just cooked. While the eggs are cooking, arrange the salad into 4 bowls.

Just simple fresh ingredients. This recipe is one of the easiest and most delicious things to do with a pork fillet, and personal favourite of mine. Grain mustard is a classic pairing for pork, and combined with creamy mashed potatoes and cabbage, it’s an absolute winner!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>2 pork fillets</li>\n  <li>1 savoy cabbage</li>\n  <li>50ml of double cream</li>\n  <li>4 Maris Piper potatoes, or King Edward</li>\n  <li>65g of unsalted butter</li>\n  <li>30ml of whole milk</li>\n  <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>ground white pepper</li>\n  <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>\n  <li>2 shallots</li>\n  <li>2 sprigs of thyme</li>\n  <li>1 bay leaf</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of sage</li>\n  <li>100ml of cooking brandy</li>\n  <li>1 teaspoon of wholegrain mustard</li>\n  <li>vegetable oil, for cooking</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 170C. Prick the potatoes with a skewer, then place in the oven for about 1hr 30mins, until soft and cooked through. Cut the potatoes in half, then scoop the potato from the skins and either mash with a masher or pass through a sieve. Place into a wide-based pan, and over a medium-low heat, add ½ teaspoon of salt, and mix. Add 30g of the butter, one dice at a time, then add the milk. Continue to cook out until you have a completely smooth, silky texture. Adjust the seasoning with salt and white pepper if need be.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>While you’re waiting for the potatoes, make the sauce: trim the pork fillets of all sinew, and cut off the small head or “chateau” from the end. Cut all the trimmings approximately 1cm dice. In a large, heavy-based pan, heat 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over a high heat. Season the trimmings with salt and black pepper, then fry until golden all over, and strain in a colander. Meanwhile, thinly slice the shallots, and crush the clove of garlic. Add the shallots, thyme, bay, sage and garlic to the same pan and turn the heat to medium. Add a pinch of salt, and gently cook the shallots for about 10 minutes, until they are soft. Add the pork trimmings back to the pan, along with the brandy. Boil, and reduce until completely dry. Now cover with cold water, and boil to reduce until dry. Repeat this 3 times, but on the last time, only reduce by half, then strain the sauce into a separate pan. Add the cream, and continue to reduce until you have a nice sauce consistency. Lastly, add the mustard, and mix.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>To cook the pork fillet: heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large heavy-based pan over a high heat. Season the fillets all over with salt and white pepper. Fry the fillets all over until golden and caramelised. Place the pan in the oven for 3 minutes. Remove from the oven, and add the remaining 25g butter. Heat until foaming, then add 1 sprig of thyme and 1 crushed clove of garlic. Baste the pork fillet for about 2 minutes, turning over after 1 minute. Cook until the pork is still slightly pink in the middle. Transfer to a rack and leave in a warm place to rest for at least 10 minutes.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Prepare the cabbage: Remove and discard the dark green outer layers. Take the inner leaves off and remove the woody veins. Thinly slice the cabbage, then set aside. Heat a little vegetable oil in a wide-based pan over a medium-high heat, and saute the cabbage, with a pinch of salt, until lightly coloured. Turn the heat to low, then add the remaining 10g of butter. Cook gently until cabbage is tender taste, and add more salt if needed.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>To serve, place a spoonful of the mashed potato in the centre of the plate, with a spoonful of cabbage next to it.

    "content": "<p><img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/crab_salad.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Of all the delicious things in the world to eat, crab is easily one of my favourites. It’s got an intense flavour of the sea and it’s succulent, sweet and juicy. In short, it’s fantastic. Preparing crab involves a bit of work and is fairly time consuming… but it’s a labour of love and something I’d urge everyone to try. Cooked in generously seasoned water, the beautiful white meat is excellent whilst still warm, eaten straight from the shell. It hardly needs anything more, although mix it with a little mayonnaise, herbs and lemon juice and you have the beginnings of a delicious salad. I’ve been wanting to write a crab recipe for a while now, but found it difficult to think of a really photogenic looking dish that wasn’t just a rip-off from one of the restaurants I’ve worked in. The custard part of this dish is similar to a crab creme brulee that we did at Wedgwood, and it’s really tasty. The sweet flavour of crab infuses really well in cream, and the fresh herbs added at the end finish it off beautifully.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>1 brown crab</li>\n  <li>1 carrot</li>\n  <li>1/2 leek</li>\n  <li>1 fennel</li>\n  <li>2 star anise</li>\n  <li>1 thyme</li>\n  <li>600ml of whipping cream</li>\n  <li>50ml of whole milk</li>\n  <li>1 parsley</li>\n  <li>1 dill</li>\n  <li>1 tarragon</li>\n  <li>1 baby gem lettuce</li>\n  <li>1 spring onion</li>\n  <li>1 chives</li>\n  <li>2 pieces of medium sliced white bread</li>\n  <li>6 egg yolks</li>\n  <li>cayenne pepper, or piment d’espelette</li>\n  <li>1 tablespoon of mayonnaise</li>\n  <li>2 tablespoons of croutons</li>\n  <li>lemon</li>\n  <li>sea salt</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil. Season generously with salt (it should be almost as salty as the sea.) Drop the crab in the water, bring back to the boil, remove from the heat and allow to cool for at least 40 minutes. Remove the crab from the water, and place on a tray.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Break off the claws, and smash them carefully with a hammer or large knife, trying not to smash into too many small pieces. Separate the meat from the shell, trying to keep it in nice big chunks. Repeat the process with the legs. Now prise the body from the main shell of the crab, and remove and discard the lungs (“dead man’s fingers”). Cut the body in half and carefully scrape out the meat with a crab picker or use the handle of a teaspoon. Cut the pieces in half again and scrape more out - you’ll be surprised how much is hidden in all the cavities. Carefully check the crab meat for pieces of shell, cover and place in the fridge.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 200C. Place a roasting tray in the oven until very hot, then add 3-4 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Smash all the crab shell into small pieces with a heavy knife or rolling pin, then place in the roasting tray. Stir once, then return to the oven for 30 minutes, stirring halfway.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Meanwhile, thinly slice all the vegetables, keeping the carrots separate. In a large pot, fry the carrots and star anise in a little vegetable oil with a generous pinch of salt, until lightly coloured. Add the rest of the vegetables and sweat over a medium heat for about 20 minutes.The shells should be lightly coloured. Deglaze the tray with the white wine, and reduce until dry. Add the shells to the pot of vegetables, and the tomato, roughly chopped. Add the cream to the pot, and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 30 minutes, then roughly chop the herbs (reserving some chives and dill for the salad) and add to the pot. Cover with clingfilm and leave to infuse for 30 minutes.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Pass the crab cream through a fine sieve, rinsing the shell pulp with the milk. Discard the pulp. Taste the cream and adjust the seasoning if it needs. Weigh the cream, and then place 1 egg yolk for every 100g of cream in a separate pan. Boil the cream, then pour slowly over the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Now heat the crab custard over a low heat, stirring constantly with a plastic spatula to ensure it doesn’t stick. When it is thick, and coats the back of the spatula (should be 80C), it is ready. Pour into 6 wide creme brulee dishes, filling only to 2mm deep. You may have some custard left over which you can just set in separate ramekins to be enjoyed on their own. Place the ramekins in the fridge to set, for at least two hours.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>To make the crab salad: finely slice the lettuce and the spring onion, cut the reserved chives and pick the dill into fronds. Place everything in a bowl with the picked crab meat, the croutons and add just enough mayonnaise to lightly bind it together; you may not need all of it, it depends on how much crab meat you have. Season with sea salt if it needs, and lemon juice. Divide the mixture into 6 and place in the middle of the custard ramekins. Finally sprinkle over a little cayenne pepper.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n",

    "content": "<p><img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/roasted_mushroom_soup.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>I have long been an advocate of the humble button mushroom. It’s one of these ingredients that’s so commonplace, I reckon it’s not appreciated to its full potential. A staple in your greasy breakfast fry-up, or as a mediocre ‘cream of mushroom soup’, the button mushroom is actually so much better that you might realise. They are high in umami – the taste that makes things savory – and they have a lot of powerful flavour locked inside. One of their characteristics is that they have an extremely high water content, making the flavour rather bland until you have reduced the moisture. I’ve also found that when you fry them in a hot pan with a pinch of salt until they’re dark and caramelised, the flavour is amazingly intense and savory. This is what gave me the idea of doing a roast mushroom soup. It’d be better than the average mushroom soup as it would be a rich golden colour, instead of grey, and the resulting flavour would be all the more powerful.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>450g of baby button mushrooms</li>\n  <li>1 onion</li>\n  <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>\n  <li>2 rashers  of streaky bacon</li>\n  <li>3 sprigs of rosemary</li>\n  <li>1 1/2litres of chicken stock</li>\n  <li>2 tablespoons of sea salt</li>\n  <li>4 tablespoons of olive oil</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Set 12 mushrooms aside, and slice the rest of them in half. Sprinkle the halved mushrooms with the sea salt so they’re evenly covered, then place in a colander set over a bowl. Leave in the fridge for about 6 hours, or overnight.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 180C, and put a medium sized roasting tray in to heat up. Briefly rinse the mushrooms with cold water, then squeeze them with your hands to remove as much moisture as possible. Pat them dry with kitchen paper.

Roast the mushrooms, tossing occasionally, until they are dark and caramelised.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion and garlic, and dice the bacon.

Once the mushrooms are nicely coloured, remove the rosemary from the roasting tray and add the mushrooms to the pan of onions. Add about 1 litre of chicken stock - enough to just cover the mushrooms - and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover with a lid, and simmer for 30 minutes, topping up with chicken stock when it reduces too much.Blend the soup in a food processor on full power for 5 minutes, until you have a silky smooth texture. You may need to add a little more stock to get the required consistency.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>To finish; slice the 12 reserved mushrooms in half, season with salt and saute them to get a nice roasted colour. Pick the leaves from the remaining rosemary sprig and fry these in olive oil until just crisp.

It’s so hot today I have opened all the windows and there is a warm breeze blowing through the room.

The loin meat from the top half of the saddle - the best end - is some of nicest and most tender from the whole animal. Keep the chops attached and you have a rack of lamb, perfect to roast whole and carve into classic lamb cutlets. The bottom half of the saddle - the short saddle - does not have any rib bones and so you would normally just roast this as a piece of loin. What we do in the restaurant is a little more special however; we take the loin from the bone, leaving a flap of the belly fat attached, then make a stuffing from sauteed kidneys and spinach and roll the loin up inside the fat. The saddle is then tied with string and roasted. It’s a lovely way to cook the loin meat as it’s quite well protected from the surrounding fat.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>1 short saddle of lamb, belly flaps attached</li>\n  <li>2 lamb kidneys</li>\n  <li>200g of baby spinach</li>\n  <li>6 pitted black olives</li>\n  <li>1 shallot</li>\n  <li>1 small clove of clove of garlic</li>\n  <li>3 green courgettes</li>\n  <li>3 yellow courgettes</li>\n  <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>\n  <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>\n  <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Carefully remove the bone from the short saddle, being careful not to leave any of the meat attached to the bone. Trim off the skin from the layer of fat, being very careful not to make any holes in the flap, as we need this intact in order to wrap around the loins. You now have 2 pieces of loin with a flap of fat attached to each. Place the layer of fat on a chopping board and bash it out with the flat part of a heavy knife, to flatten the fat to a nice thin layer. Again, be careful not to make any holes. Place the loins in the fridge.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Get a medium pan hot on the stove, and sautee the spinach with a pinch of salt until gently wilted. Transfer to a colander and leave to chill in the fridge. Meanwhile, finely chop the shallot and garlic and sweat slowly in olive oil until soft. Transfer to a bowl. Roughly chop the black olive and add to the bowl. Now take the lamb kidneys and remove the outer membrane. Cut in half lengthways and cut out the white gristle from inside. Cut the kidneys into 5mm dice, then fry in a hot pan until lightly coloured. Remove, and add to the bowl with the shallots, garlic and olive. Once the spinach is cold, squeeze all the remaining moisture from it by wringing in your hands. Mix together with the kidney and shallot mixture. Season to taste with salt and cracked black pepper.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Divide the mix into two, one half for each loin. Lay out the loin on a board with the fat facing towards you. Place the spinach mix tight into the join of where the loin meets the fat, then roll it up, with the fat wrapping around the loin. Tie securely with butcher’s twine. Repeat with the other loin. Place the stuffed saddles in the fridge for 30 minutes to set.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 180C. Cut 2mm slices off the courgettes lengthways, taking only the vibrant skin from the outside, and reserve the inner white part for another recipe. Cut the slices into thin strips. Set aside. Get a heavy based frying pan hot on the stove, and fry the stuffed saddles until lightly coloured all over. Place in the oven for 3 minutes, then turn over. Return to the oven for 5 minutes, or until the inside temperature reaches 55C, which is medium rare. Leave the meat to rest on a rack for 15-20 minutes. Just before carving the meat, saute the courgettes in olive oil until just cooked, and season with sea salt. Carve each loin into 3 pieces, and place on top of the spaghetti of courgettes. Serve with some nice crusty bread and a glass of white wine.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

It’s an awesome ingredient that provides a remarkable amount of flavour given its size… it is small but strong! Obviously it’s more potent when raw, and when used for something like pesto or hummus, you need only a tiny bit. After cooking garlic, however, it loses most of it’s kick and becomes much more mellow. So, if you’re making a pasta sauce for example, you might want a decent amount - 3 or 4 cloves perhaps - to sweat with olive oil for the base of the sauce. Roasting garlic increases the mellowing effect even more, and gives it an amazing deep flavour. This is my favourite way to prepare garlic, and it’s perfect for making soup.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>8 bulbs of garlic</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of rosemary</li>\n  <li>300ml of double cream</li>\n  <li>500ml of brown chicken stock</li>\n  <li>1 onion</li>\n  <li>sea salt</li>\n  <li>cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>1 bunch of chives</li>\n  <li>olive oil</li>\n  <li>1 potato, about 50g</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 170C. Add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a roasting tray and get it hot. Reserve 3 cloves for the garnish later, then cut the tops off the bulbs of garlic so the tips of the cloves are poking out, then add to the roasting tray along with the rosemary and roast for about 45 minutes until the garlic is completely soft and oozing out of its skins.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Meanwhile finely slice the onion and sweat in a medium pot with olive oil, and a pinch of sea salt. Cook over a medium heat for about 25 minutes until the onion is soft, sweet and slightly caramelised. Peel the potato and finely slice it. Add to the pot and continue to cook, stirring occasionally. Squeeze the garlic out of its skins and add the soft pulp to the pot along with the cream and brown chicken stock. Simmer gently for 20 minutes, then pour everything into a food processor and blend until completely pureed and silky smooth. If it’s a little too thick, add a splash of chicken stock.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>To garnish the soup, finely slice the 3 reserved garlic cloves with a sharp knife (or a mandolin, if you have one) and saute in a little olive oil until they are lightly coloured. Be careful as they will taste bitter if you let them get too dark. Scatter these over the soup along with some finely chopped chives.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n",

Our sauce would nearly always contain some lamb due to the abundant supply in our freezer. The mince from our own lamb was usually quite fatty and, when mixed in equal parts with lean beef mince, gave a lovely depth of flavour and body to the sauce. It always tasted fantastic; ladled onto a mountain of spaghetti with handfuls of grated parmesan I would devour it with gusto. Lamb bolognese is almost unheard of, which is a shame because it’s so delicious! In my view this is tastier than the classic beef bolognese and I bet that many would agree. Saying that, the recipe I’ve made here is not a plain spag-bol but a modified version, or upgraded, I should say. I made it a little bit creamier than usual, and added extra garlic. A good pile of baby spinach is thrown in and wilted down to tangle with the spaghetti as everything is mixed together. Parmesan cheese is mixed in, along with a splash of the salted starchy pasta water and finally some cherry tomatoes at the very last just to warm through gently. The final sauce is really rich and creamy, with the spinach and tomatoes giving a juiciness that stands up to the strong flavoured lamb.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>500g of lamb mince</li>\n  <li>3 rashers of smoked streaky bacon</li>\n  <li>1 onion</li>\n  <li>1 carrot</li>\n  <li>1 stick of celery</li>\n  <li>3 large cloves of garlic</li>\n  <li>250ml of red wine</li>\n  <li>50g of tomato puree</li>\n  <li>1 litre of lamb stock, or chicken stock</li>\n  <li>1/2 teaspoon of dried chilli flakes</li>\n  <li>50ml of double cream</li>\n  <li>100g of baby spinach leaves</li>\n  <li>100g of parmesan</li>\n  <li>2 sprigs  of thyme</li>\n  <li>400g of dried spaghetti</li>\n  <li>olive oil</li>\n  <li>sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Cut the bacon into 5mm dice and in a large, wide-based pan, fry in olive oil until golden and crisp.

It’s a really nice way to prepare chicken, and pretty easy too. I like chicken legs because they have so much more flavour than the breast meat, and by removing the bones and sinew they become an effortless pleasure to eat. The great thing about this dish is when you slice the chicken leg you see the beautiful glistening cross-section of the muscle, outlined by the crispy pancetta. I served it with sautéed button mushrooms, courgettes and a white wine cream sauce, generously finished with chopped parsley and a handful of baby spinach gently wilted through the sauce at the end.

Bouchon is the three Michelin starred chef’s bistro in Yountville, California that serves French classics like beef bourguignon, salt cod brandade, and quiche. There is a chapter on the quiche where Keller talks about the lost art of making great quiche; something which seems to have gone out of fashion, or forgotten about. A proper quiche will be two inches deep, filled to the very brim with a barely set, perfectly light custard. The shortcrust pastry should be rich and crisp, and specifically 4-5mm thick, so that it remains crisp and doesn’t become soggy after cooking. I had a couple of attempts at this quiche before getting a satisfactory result, and I was pleased with my third try. I actually bought a 9″ quiche ring especially for the task as none of the pastry rings in my house were quite the right size. One of the brilliant things about this recipe is the lightness of the custard; Keller blitzes the custard mix in a blender before pouring into the pastry shell, aerating the mix and resulting in a delicate light filling. This recipe is more or less the same as that found in Bouchon, but I’ve added spinach to the filling and converted the ingredients from pounds and ounces to kilograms.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>350g of plain white flour</li>\n  <li>225g of unsalted butter, chilled</li>\n  <li>65ml of ice cold water</li>\n  <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>\n  <li>500ml of whole milk</li>\n  <li>500ml of double cream</li>\n  <li>6 eggs</li>\n  <li>1 tablespoon of sea salt</li>\n  <li>1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground white pepper</li>\n  <li>6 gratings of fresh nutmeg</li>\n  <li>3 leeks</li>\n  <li>200g of baby spinach</li>\n  <li>150g of roquefort cheese, crumbled</li>\n  <li>olive oil</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>To make the pastry: cut the butter into small dice, and rub into the flour and salt with fingertips until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.

Wrap, and refrigerate for at least an hour, preferably overnight.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Roll the pastry out until you have a circle about 35cm in diameter and 3-4 mm thick. Take a 9 x 2 inch plain ring and place on a tray lined with parchment paper. Carefully line the ring with the pastry, being careful to press evenly into the sides and corners. Leave about an inch of pastry hanging over the edge. This will help prevent it from shrinking inwards when baking. Reserve trimmings for patching any cracks in the pastry later. Heat the oven to 190 C. Place the pastry shell in the fridge or freezer for at least 20 minutes before cooking.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Now line the pastry with a round of parchment paper and fill with dried beans or rice, pressing gently to fill the shell completely. Blind-bake the pastry for 35 to 45 minutes, until the outside of the pastry is golden and crisp but the inside still light. Remove the beans and parchment paper and return the shell to the oven for a further 20-30 minutes, until golden and crisp inside and out. Patch any cracks with the trimmings, returning to the oven for a further 5 minutes.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 165 C, then prepare the filling: take three large leeks and slice thinly, discarding the dark green part or reserving for another recipe. Cook in a large pot of salted boiling water for 3-4 minutes, until tender. Drain on kitchen paper. Wilt the spinach by searing in a hot pan with a glug of olive oil, adding a pinch of salt. Mix with the cooked leeks. For the batter, heat the milk, cream and salt in a pan until a skin just begins to form on the surface. Place 3 eggs, half the cream mixture, 3 gratings of nutmeg and half the white pepper in a blender and blitz for about 30 seconds until foamy and light. Spread out half the leek mixture and half the roquefort in the bottom of the quiche shell, and pour over enough batter to just cover. Repeat with the remaining filling and batter mix. Fill the quiche to the very brim. Reserve any left over filling. Carefully place in the oven being careful not to spill any of the mix. Cook for about 1 ½ hours, until the quiche is nicely brown and the custard just set when jiggled. After about 20 minutes the custard will have sunk slightly in the middle as some of the air escapes the mix; simply top up with the leftover batter and return to the oven. Refrigerate for at least a day, or up to 3 days, until completely set. Slice into portions and reheat gently in the oven. Alternatively, it is just as excellent eaten cold.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

Kind of an ode to their home city, it’s filled with stories and delicious recipes. I like middle eastern food because for me it strikes a perfect balance between the heavily spiced dishes of the subcontinent further east, and the simpler, more fresh cuisine found in the mediterranean to the west. Jerusalem is an ancient city with a turbulent history; having been besieged, conquered and captured countless times. As a result it’s a city of many varying cultures, religions and traditions, and the food of Jerusalem reflects this diversity. Hummus is a big thing in the middle east, especially in Jerusalem, and unsurprisingly there is an endless debate from opposing cultures about how it should be prepared; warm or cold… smooth and creamy or rustic and chunky. And which spices or garnishes to accompany it, if any at all. Most of the hummus I have had from the shops here in the UK have been almost smooth with a slight grainy texture to them. This recipe from Ottolenghi is really smooth and creamy, and much lighter in colour than hummus I’ve had before. It’s opened my eyes to how great hummus can be… I definitely recommend you try it! I made it into a light lunch by simply garnishing it with a pile of chopped coriander, tomatoes, pine nuts and olive oil. I devoured it with some fresh toasted pitta bread. Fantastic.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>250g of dried chickpeas</li>\n  <li>1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda</li>\n  <li>270g of light tahini paste</li>\n  <li>4 tablespoons of lemon juice</li>\n  <li>4 garlic cloves</li>\n  <li>100ml of ice cold water</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Wash the chickpeas in cold water, then cover with at least twice their volume of water and leave overnight.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Drain the chickpeas.

Cook, whilst stirring, for about 3 minutes, then add 1.5litres of cold water and bring to the boil, skimming any scum that rises. Simmer gently for 20-40 minutes, or until the chickpeas are very tender but not mushy.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Drain the chickpeas and place in a food processor. Blend until you have a thick paste, then, with the machine running, add the tahini paste, lemon juice, garlic and 1 ½ teaspoons of salt.

The first thing that came to my mind was soup, and since we were in the middle of winter I was thinking along the lines of a chunky, meaty broth. I decided on Chicken, which would provide my soup with both the chunky meat component and the stock. A bunch of fresh coriander which also happened to be in my fridge could be involved here in some way, I thought. I remembered a Madhur Jaffrey recipe for coriander chicken curry, involving large quantities of fresh coriander, resulting in a vibrant green curry sauce. It was fantastic, and so I reckoned it could work in my soup too. The earthiness of all those root vegetables would be balanced by the fresh zing of the coriander. I prepared the chicken in my usual way; removed the breasts, then cut up the remaining carcass into small pieces and fried until nicely caramelised for the stock. This time I actually chopped up the wings and legs too and added them to the stock for extra flavour. Once the stock was almost ready, after an hour or so, I took some out to gently poach the breast meat in a separate pan. Once perfectly barely cooked, I allowed them to cool before carefully cutting them into dice. All the vegetables and chicken diced to the same size, making for an attractive looking bowl of broth.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>2 guineafowl legs</li>\n  <li>200g of puy lentils</li>\n  <li>3 rashers of smoked streaky bacon</li>\n  <li>1 carrot</li>\n  <li>100g of swede</li>\n  <li>100g of celeriac</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of thyme</li>\n  <li>1 bay leaf</li>\n  <li>1 handful of baby spinach</li>\n  <li>1 bunch  of parsley</li>\n  <li>1 clove of garlic</li>\n  <li>1 onion</li>\n  <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>olive oil</li>\n  <li>white wine vinegar</li>\n  <li>unsalted butter</li>\n  <li>300g of duck or goose fat</li>\n  <li>300ml of chicken stock</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Sprinkle the guinea fowl legs in sea salt and cracked black pepper and place in the fridge overnight, or 8 hours.

Transfer to a container, pour the fat over and refrigerate. Leave for at least one week for the flavours to mature, or up to 2 months. The confit will keep for a long time preserved like this.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>To make the lentils; finely dice the onion and fry gently in olive oil with a pinch of salt until soft.

Probably closer to minestrone than tomato, It’s thick and hearty, guaranteed to fill you up. Instead of pasta, as in a typical minestrone, this soup has a handful of rice thrown in the beginning which swells up to thicken the liquid and give it some body. You could use lentils instead, if you prefer. This is a chunky, broth-like soup rather than being smooth and silky, and although I like to cut all the vegetables to a nice uniform shape and size, you can cut them any old way and be as rustic as you like. As with many soups, the quality of this one comes down to the stock. I will usually make this soup after cooking a joint of smoked gammon or bacon, using the delicious salty liquid as the meaty backbone for my tomatoey broth. I highly advise this, if not then some nice vegetable stock is an acceptable alternative. This soup is best enjoyed with freshly baked bread and butter.

It’s hard not to adore this. Chicken confit is not often heard of, but it’s a great way to elevate the humble chicken leg to new tasty new heights. Lemon chicken was something my mum often made when we were young. Simply place some chicken legs in a roasting tray with olive oil, lemons and seasoning and roast in a hot oven until golden and crisp. You get a load of amazingly tasty juices in the tray which are spooned over potatoes or mopped up with crusty bread. One of my favourite ever meals! So this is a new version of that dish; the confit chicken has a superior texture, and the lemon and olive oil dressing is enriched with the jus from the confit and loaded with chopped fresh herbs. For this one, I served it with some sauteed pak choi and buttered new potatoes.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>4 chicken legs, or thighs</li>\n  <li>600g of duck or goose fat</li>\n  <li>2 tablespoons of coarse sea salt</li>\n  <li>2 lemons</li>\n  <li>5 tablespoons of olive oil</li>\n  <li>1 small handful of chives</li>\n  <li>1 small handful of parsley</li>\n  <li>1 small handful of tarragon</li>\n  <li>a few drops of white wine vinegar</li>\n  <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Firstly, cure the chicken legs by placing them in a tray and rubbing in a couple of handfuls of the coarse sea salt. Cover, and leave in the fridge for 6-8 hours.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Set the oven to 140C. Wash off the salt from the chicken legs, then place in a pot and add enough duck fat to just cover them. Bring up to temperature on the stove to melt the fat, then cover and place in the oven for about 1 hour, or until the meat is just tender and almost falling off the bone. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely in the fat. If you wish you can store the chicken legs like this in the fridge for several weeks.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Remove the chicken legs from the fat. There will be a layer of chicken jus settled in the bottom of the pot; take this and reserve it for the dressing, it’s delicious! Get a pan hot on the stove, and fry the legs in a few tablespoons of vegetable oil until the skin is golden and very crisp. While the chicken legs are cooking, make the dressing. Mix the chicken jus with the juice of two lemons, and whisk in the olive oil gradually. Finally add the herbs, and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper and a few drops of white wine vinegar.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

It was the start of a beautiful relationship with this Italian classic; now a staple in my repertoire, I must have made hundreds of risottos, including a few variations…barley is a nice alternative to rice and perfect to serve with chicken. We feed barley to the hens on the farm, so this seems like an apt combination for a dish. A benefit of using barley instead of rice is that it’s considerably more difficult to overcook. Also the grains give a lovely bursting sensation when you chew them which is fantastic. Firstly, I like to caramelise some finely diced pancetta or home-cured bacon to release some vital fat and get an amazing flavour base before adding finely chopped onion to sweat down slowly and gently. I will sweat the onion for a good fifteen minutes before adding anything else, making sure they become soft and sweet. To add some extra flavour and a nice touch of colour, I cooked some carrot dice and some baby button mushrooms in a separate pan to be stirred into the risotto at the very end, along with a generous handful of chopped herbs.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>400g of pearl barley</li>\n  <li>2 onions</li>\n  <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>\n  <li>75g of streaky bacon</li>\n  <li>250ml of dry white wine</li>\n  <li>1 1/2litres of chicken stock</li>\n  <li>125g of baby button mushrooms</li>\n  <li>2 carrots</li>\n  <li>1 handful of chives, finely chopped</li>\n  <li>1 handful of parsley, finely chopped</li>\n  <li>80g of parmesan</li>\n  <li>150g of unsalted butter</li>\n  <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>\n  <li>olive oil</li>\n  <li>sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>8 chicken thighs or drumsticks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 180C, toss the chicken drumsticks in olive oil and roast for about 30 minutes, until golden and crisp.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Cut the pancetta into small dice and fry in a little oil until nicely coloured.

Some like to include condiments such as Worcester sauce, tomato ketchup, mustard, lemon juice and even brandy. One thing is pretty indisputable though, which is that the meat – being the central aspect of the dish – should be of the highest possible quality. I have had discussions about steak tartare with Alan, fellow Wedgwood chef, who believes that this dish is a pure and simple celebration of meat and should be accompanied by little more than some herbs and seasoning.

We would perch on tiny plastic stools with soup and chopsticks in hand, slurping down the powerful broth while millions of motorbikes provided a symphony of background humming. The most common – and best – was pho bo, rich dark beef stock laden with strips of tender meat and tendons of beef, fragrant spices and light noodles. There was always a basket of bright leaves served alongside, herb-like greens which, when torn in rustic pieces into the bowl gave the perfect balance of freshness to the meaty soup. This is my own, slightly simpler version of noodle broth. Although it doesn’t compare to proper Vietnamese pho it’s a reasonable substitute! To make this recipe you will need to invest some time in making proper beef stock. This takes at least eight hours of gentle simmering and I urge you to do this; the resulting flavour will be far superior than any shop-bought alternative. I haven’t added any actual meat to the soup as I reckoned there is enough flavour from the stock alone, but feel free to add some strips of cooked beef if you wish.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>3kg of beef bones</li>\n  <li>2 carrots</li>\n  <li>1 onion</li>\n  <li>1/2 bulb of garlic, cut in two crossways</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of thyme</li>\n  <li>1 bay leaf</li>\n  <li>250ml of red wine</li>\n  <li>1 fresh red chilli, finely sliced</li>\n  <li>20g of root ginger, finely sliced</li>\n  <li>2 celery sticks</li>\n  <li>1 leek, white part only, finely sliced</li>\n  <li>4 spring onions</li>\n  <li>100g of dried egg noodles</li>\n  <li>sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>soy sauce</li>\n  <li>toasted sesame oil</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Firstly make the beef stock: Heat the oven to 200C and roast the bones until dark golden brown. Meanwhile, roughly chop 1 carrot and the onion and, along with the garlic, lightly brown in vegetable oil in a large pan. Add the wine and boil for 3 minutes to remove the alcohol. Add the beef bones, the thyme and bay leaf. Fill with cold water until just covered, then slowly bring to the boil, skimming any scum that rises. Simmer very gently for 8 hours, topping up with more cold water when necessary. Strain off the liquid into a clean pan, and boil until reduced to about 1 litre. For the last 10 minutes add the ginger and chilli. Season carefully with salt, and set aside.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Peel the carrot into ribbons and finely slice. Peel the celery and finely slice. Add all the vegetables except the spring onion to the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes. Lift out with a slotted spoon and rinse under cold water.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Cook the noodles in the boiling vegetable water for 4 minutes, then drain. Divide the noodles and vegetables between 4 bowls, then ladle the hot beef stock over the top. Sprinkle the spring onions over the top, and serve.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

It’s easy to rustle up pretty quickly, and if you make your own authentic caesar dressing as we did, it’s proper and delicious too. The dressing is key to this dish; it’s a super-enriched mayonnaise, packed with powerful savoriness from garlic, parmesan, anchovies and olive oil. The richness is balanced by a vital squeeze of lemon juice. We always used chicken breast, gently baked in the oven until just cooked, but I’ve switched to using leg now as the darker flakey meat has more flavour and a more pleasing rustic feel that is nicely suited to this dish. This salad provides a fantastic interplay of textures; balancing juicy shredded chicken with crunchy fresh leaves of lettuce and crisp bacon, all bound happily together by the glossy rich dressing. Extra crunch is given by lovely golden croutons.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>2 chicken legs</li>\n  <li>2 baby gem lettuce</li>\n  <li>4 rashers of dry-cured streaky bacon</li>\n  <li>2 slices of thick white bread</li>\n  <li>100ml of olive oil, plus a little extra for cooking</li>\n  <li>2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese, grated</li>\n  <li>1 anchovy</li>\n  <li>1 lemon</li>\n  <li>1 egg yolk</li>\n  <li>1 clove of garlic, finely chopped</li>\n  <li>sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 180C. Rub the chicken legs with olive oil, season generously with sea salt and place in a roasting tin, then roast in the oven until the skin is crisp and golden and the meat falling off the bone. Remove from the oven, leave to cool slightly then pick the meat off the bone, shredding it to medium sized pieces. Keep the roasting juices from the tray, skimming and discarding any fat from the surface.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>While the chicken is cooking, fry the bacon in olive oil until crisp, then cut into chunky lardons. Cut the bread into dice, then fry in olive oil, stirring constantly until light golden. Transfer to a tray lined with kitchen paper immediately to drain. Set aside.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Now for the dressing; finely grate the parmesan and place in a bowl with the egg yolk, anchovy, garlic and chicken roasting juices. Whisk (or use a blender) until all incorporated and smooth, then begin to add the olive oil, very gradually, until it is emulsified and you have a thick mayonnaise. Add a squeeze of lemon juice to taste, and a couple of tablespoons of water until you have a sauce-like consistency. Season with salt, if needed. Pick and wash the lettuce leaves, and to finish the salad, simply toss everything together with the dressing and throw in a bowl.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

Pies! My mouth is watering at just the thought. I already wrote about pies when I did a series of posts on classic home cooking, namely my delicious steak pie and shepherd’s pie but I really felt that chicken pie needed to be added to the collection since this meat is so popular. I was thrifty with this dish, wasting nothing, as one always should when eating meat. I took one small bird and got maximum use from it, roasting the meat on the bone then using the carcass to make some stock. I then reduced this down to intensify the flavour and enriched it with sherry and a little beurre manié to make the gravy for the pie. This dish will take most of the day to cook, but I make no apologies for this. I hate to compromise flavour for the sake of saving time. In any case, there are few things that I enjoy more than spending all afternoon in the kitchen creating something delicious. I served it with some leeks sauteed in butter, and it was fantastic.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>1 free range chicken</li>\n  <li>200g of smoked ham, cut into chunks</li>\n  <li>50g of unsalted butter</li>\n  <li>500g of puff pastry</li>\n  <li>some beurre manie</li>\n  <li>2 handfuls of flat leaf parsley</li>\n  <li>1 bunch  of basil leaves</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of thyme, leaves picked</li>\n  <li>1/2 onion</li>\n  <li>1 stick of celery</li>\n  <li>2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>\n  <li>100ml of dry sherry</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 180C. Soften the butter and using your fingers rub all over the chicken and in between the skin and breast meat. Roughly chop the basil and half of the parsley and also stuff this under the skin of the breast. Season liberally with sea salt and place the chicken in a roasting dish into the oven for about 1 hour and 30 minutes or until the meat is just cooked, tender and juicy basting with the juices and butter every 20 minutes.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>When the chicken has cooled slightly, take all of the meat off the carcass and roughly chop. Set aside. To make the stock: Now break the carcass up into small pieces using a meat hammer or cleaver. Set a deep, thick bottomed pan over a high heat and pour in a couple of glugs of vegetable oil or rapeseed oil. Fry the chicken bones, turning occasionally, until they are uniformly golden brown. Add 1 carrot, the onion, celery and garlic and fry for a couple of minutes. Pour in enough cold water to just cover the bones and bring to the boil, skimming any froth or fat that rises to the surface. Simmer gently for 4 hours.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Strain the stock into a separate pan, add a glassful of dry cooking sherry and boil until reduced by 1/3. Take the 2 remaining carrots and cut into chunky dice. Cook these until tender in the stock while it is reducing, removing them with a slotted spoon once done. Whisk in a few pieces of beurre manié into the reduced stock until a nice gravy consistency is achieved. Stir in the remaining parsley and the thyme, roughly chopped, and add the carrots, chicken meat and smoked ham. Season carefully with salt and pepper, then leave to cool completely.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Now to build the pie: roll out the puff pastry to about 5mm thick. Pour the chicken mixture into a pie dish and drape the pastry over, pushing the edges down with a fork. Use the trimmings to decorate the top. Make two slits for steam to escape, then brush liberally with egg wash. Place in the oven at 180C until the pastry is nice and golden.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

The beauty of preserving food is that fresh fruit and veg which is in season and plentiful can be enjoyed throughout the year when it is no longer available. Nowadays in supermarkets one can buy almost any vegetable at any time of year as food is imported from all over the world, but if you care about using seasonal and local produce – as I do – then you will also see the huge benefit in preserving. Rene Redzepi, head chef at Noma in Copenhagen, is the master of using seasonal and local produce. In summer is all the more crucial.I had a recipe for this amazing red onion chutney which I thought I’d lost. The last time I made it I couldn’t find the recipe so had to improvise and, although tasty, it wasn’t as good as the original. The old recipe was an adaptation of the red onion chutney that we used to make at Blackmore’s. I changed the spices and added white wine for extra flavour. It has a fantastic rich sweetness that is hard not to adore. This chutney, as with many pickles, improves and matures with age. Ideally it should be left in the jar for at least six months before eating. It will taste great if eaten immediately of course, but I recommend waiting! Serve this chutney with cheese and crackers, or put in a cheese and ham sandwich for an extra punch of flavour.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>2kg of red onions</li>\n  <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>\n  <li>1 star anise</li>\n  <li>1 bay leaf</li>\n  <li>3 cloves</li>\n  <li>400ml of red wine vinegar</li>\n  <li>400ml of dry white wine</li>\n  <li>400g of soft light brown sugar</li>\n  <li>3 cloves of garlic, lightly crushed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Peel and thinly slice the onions along the grain and place in a wide-based pot.

In expanding my culinary repertoire I will embrace all types of food equally, both sweet and savoury! Tarte Tatin is a dessert that we used to do for lunch at Wedgwood; it’s a classic French dish, delicious and quite easy to make. As with a lot of food I love, I really appreciate the simplicity of it. The combination of rich sweet caramel and tart apples is balanced beautifully by the smoothness from the butter; these are flavours that were made for each other. It’s the prime season for apples right now so this is a good time to make it! I’ve never tried making puff pastry from scratch before, as I know it’s a time consuming process, but I’d like to do it some time. I’ll put a recipe up on here when I do, but for now I’m just using ready-rolled pastry from the shop which is of pretty good quality anyway and saves a lot of time. Just four ingredients make up this amazing dessert: apples, sugar, butter and puff pastry. As for the apples, a tart eating variety is needed – I recommend Cox as the best option as they have a great flavour and also hold their shape well when cooked instead of turning mushy. Since it’s such a simple dish, the quality of each individual ingredient is more important so I would suggest getting a block of some really nice expensive butter for this. Desserts are a luxury anyway so you might as well do it properly!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>4 cox apples</li>\n  <li>100g of caster sugar</li>\n  <li>30g of unsalted butter, chilled</li>\n  <li>400g of puff pastry</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 180C. Put the caster sugar in an even layer into a metal handled frying pan (approx 20cm diameter) and place over a low heat until the sugar has caramelised to a uniform golden brown.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>While the sugar is heating, peel, core and slice the apples into eighths. Roll out the puff pastry to about 2-3mm thickness and cut a circle about 1/2 an inch wider than the inner diameter of the frying pan.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Cut the butter into small dice and set aside. Once the caramel is ready, add the butter in a even layer followed immediately by the apples, rounded sides down. Leave to cook for 2 minutes until the caramel has softened and the butter has melted.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Cover carefully with the puff pastry and tuck the edges in. Prick the top several times with a sharp knife to allow steam to escape. Now place in the oven for 15 minutes until the pastry is cooked through, nice and golden.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Have a cooling rack ready; remove the tarte from the oven and leave for 1 minute, then quickly turn it out onto the rack upside-down. The caramelised apples should release from the pan nicely. Leave to cool slightly, then eat! Excellent with vanilla ice-cream.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

Chocolate is a steadfast ingredient in any dessert menu and quite fascinating to work with. Recently I have just learned how to temper chocolate to give it an amazingly shiny, brittle finish. It’s not the easiest thing to achieve; a precise technique that’s really satisfying when it works properly! Another thing I’ve been getting my head around is chocolate mousse; a classic dessert which is subtly difficult to perfect. I remember making it when I was young; whipped cream folded into melted chocolate, always resulting in a smooth but rather dense and rich mousse. A perfect mousse should be really light and have a true melt-in-the-mouth texture; not what I have in my memories of childhood! The lightness comes from incorporating whipped cream and whipped egg whites into the melted chocolate, but the result depends of the temperature of the chocolate; too hot and the air will collapse from the mousse; too cold and the chocolate will sieze up and become grainy. This recipe works well, the secret here is to heat and whisk egg yolks with sugar and water (or coffee, as in this recipe) to create a silky light sabayon which the chocolate is then melted into. From there I add whipped cream, and lastly some soft whipped egg whites to make it extra light and aerated.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>200g of good quality dark chocolate (70%)</li>\n  <li>200g of double cream</li>\n  <li>75g of caster sugar</li>\n  <li>2 egg whites</li>\n  <li>3 egg yolks</li>\n  <li>50g espresso, cooled</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Place the egg yolks, 50g of sugar and coffee in a bowl and whisk over a pan of simmering water until thick and silky to create a sabayon. Mix in the chocolate and stir until melted. Take off the heat and set aside.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Quickly whip the cream until it forms soft peaks. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they also form soft peaks, then gradually add the remaining 25g of caster sugar whilst continuing to whisk vigorously, until fully incorporated. Set aside. Pour the chocolate sabayon into another bowl to cool it slightly (it should be around 35-40 C), then fold the cream in stages, mixing the first spoonful vigorously to stabilise the mixture so it doesn’t sieze. Once the cream is mixed in, gently fold the egg white mixture in.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Pour the mousse into moulds or dishes and leave in the fridge for a minimum of 6 hours to set.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

This bird is rich in taste, tender in texture and a deep red colour; winning attributes I’m sure you’ll agree. At work we have made duck confit, pan fried breast (cooked pink and moist), terrine and rillettes. I also made some duck ham at home which was delicious. Duck’s versatility speaks for itself; there are a myriad different ways to prepare it. The best thing about it though is the thick layer of insulating fat under it’s skin which keeps the animal warm in freezing cold weather. For chefs this is the most indispensable part of the animal; the fat melts during cooking, keeping the meat beautifully moist and succulent. Excess fat collects in the bottom of the roasting tray but should never be thrown away! This is essential for your confit. This method of cooking meat was originally used for preservation, a form of charcuterie. Meat that had been lightly cured, then slowly and gently cooked in it’s own fat was then left to cool, the fat setting around the meat, completely sealing it from any moisture or bacteria from the air. When left for 5-6 months in a cool larder, the flavours had matured, resulting in a true authentic confit. It is not essential to mature your confit for quite this long; a fantastic flavour is still achievable in a few days.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>4 duck legs</li>\n  <li>about 400ml of duck fat</li>\n  <li>1 sprig  of thyme</li>\n  <li>1 bay leaf</li>\n  <li>5 black peppercorns</li>\n  <li>200g of salt</li>\n  <li>100g of sugar</li>\n  <li>1 blade of mace</li>\n  <li>1 clove</li>\n  <li>1 star anise</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Firstly, make your cure mix. This can be as simple as just salt and sugar (ratio 2:1) but you may add extra flavourings and spices if you wish. For mine I used 200g salt, 100g sugar, and a small handful of spices: cloves, star anise, cinnamon, juniper berries, all finely ground.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Lightly sprinkle some of the cure mix onto the duck legs and rub into the flesh and skin. Cover, and leave in the fridge for 8 hours or overnight. Set the oven to 150C, and thoroughly wash the salt off the duck legs. Place in a casserole tray and cover with the duck fat, ensuring that they are completely covered. Add the thyme, bay leaf and peppercorns. Place in the oven for 3-4 hours or until the meat is extremely tender and falling off the bone.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Remove from the oven, and allow to cool slightly, then carefully strip all the meat from the bone, being careful to discard any sinew or gristle. Place the meat in a bowl and work with a spoon until the meat is finely shredded. Now add a few tablespoons of the duck fat and continue to work the mixture. You should have a smooth, moist paste. Add enough duck fat until this consistency is achieved. Taste, and adjust the seasoning. Roll into a cylinder in cling film and place in the fridge to set. Serve with melba toast, chutney and salad.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

It’s a rustic French classic that is hard to beat as a crowd pleaser; a perfect marriage of ingredients that seem destined to accompany one another. Who could fail to adore this? Although these days it’s usually made with chicken (as I did), a traditional coq au vin is made with a mature cockerel. The meat from such a bird will be dark and rich in flavour compared to a young hen, but correspondingly tough as a result, meaning that it needs to be braised gently for a long time to make it tender. So I was looking forward to some tasty chicken slowly cooked in red wine… and to complete this classic dish, simply add small button mushrooms, baby pearl onions and some chunky dice of pancetta. Mmmm.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>4 free range chicken legs, separated into drumsticks and thighs</li>\n  <li>850ml of red wine</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of thyme</li>\n  <li>1 bay leaf</li>\n  <li>1 stick of celery</li>\n  <li>1/2 leek</li>\n  <li>2 carrots</li>\n  <li>1 onion</li>\n  <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>\n  <li>20 buttom mushrooms</li>\n  <li>100g of pancetta, cut into 1cm cubes</li>\n  <li>12 baby pearl onions</li>\n  <li>some beurre manie</li>\n  <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>\n  <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Separate the thighs from the drumsticks and place in a suitably sized tub or ziplock bag. Crush the garlic, then chop the carrot, celery, onion, and leek into rough 1cm dice and add everything to the chicken along with the wine, thyme and bay leaf. Leave in the fridge to marinate for 1 day. Put the chicken breasts aside for another recipe. Make a simple stock with carcass; crush slightly and snugly fit it into a medium-small pot. Cover with cold water and slowly bring to the boil, skimming any scum that rises. Simmer gently for 3 hours, then strain and discard the bones. Reduce the stock by half, and place in the fridge until needed.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 180C. Transfer the chicken and it’s marinade to a roasting tray, then bring to the boil on the stove top and simmer for 3 minutes to remove the alcohol. Place in the oven for about 45minutes, or until the meat is tender.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Meanwhile, heat a frying pan and cook the pancetta, onions and mushrooms over a high flame until nice and golden. Add the chicken stock to de-glaze, then simmer until the mushrooms and onions are just tender. Set aside.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>When the chicken is cooked, remove from the tray and pat the skin dry with kitchen towel. Strain the braising liquid into a saucepan, and add the chicken stock poured off the from the mushrooms and shallots pan. Bring to the boil and reduce by about two thirds, until it is dark and rich. Season to taste, and thicken with a little beurre manie. While the sauce is reducing, crisp the chicken skin; in a frying pan heat some oil over a medium-low flame and brown the chicken, being careful not to burn it. The skin should be dark and caramelised. Serve with the mushrooms, shallots, pancetta and sauce poured over. Excellent with mashed potato or boiled new potatoes</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/shepherds_pie.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Here’s another classic to add to the collection. It seems pretty appropriate that shepherd’s pie was a staple dish for us, at home on a sheep farm in rural Northumberland. I think this dish was traditionally made with left over meat from a roast dinner, but my Mum usually made it with our own lamb or mutton mince, which was a bit fattier than shop-bought mince and stronger in flavour; it was always really rich and filling. I’ve adapted the recipe here; instead of mince I’m using neck and slowly braising it on the bone. The neck is a pretty tough cut of meat so it needs cooking for a long time. It’s more flavoursome than the prime cuts, however, and absolutely worth the wait. Lamb neck is probably the tastiest part of the animal in my view, and very underrated. In the kitchen at work, we use veal stock as a base for most of our sauces; for something like this shepherd’s pie for example, we would make a rich jus from reduced veal stock to mix with the filling instead of gravy. The veal bones are slowly simmered in water for 2-3 days in order to extract maximum flavour and body from them. The gelatine extracted from the bones thickens the stock when it is reduced, so you get a naturally thick, rich jus without using flour. This is impractical to do at home, but you can get some way towards a proper jus when making a dish like this by cooking the meat on the bone, or adding extra bones to the braising liquid even. After reducing, the resulting sauce will be richer and have much more body to it.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>3 lamb necks, cut in two</li>\n  <li>5 carrots</li>\n  <li>2 sticks of celery</li>\n  <li>1/2 bulb of garlic</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of thyme</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of rosemary</li>\n  <li>2 bay leaves</li>\n  <li>1 bottle of red wine</li>\n  <li>2kg of King Edward potatoes</li>\n  <li>50ml of whole milk</li>\n  <li>150g of unsalted butter, cut into small dice</li>\n  <li>1 leek</li>\n  <li>Wocester sauce</li>\n  <li>sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>\n  <li>olive oil</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 160C. In a large deep roasting tray, lightly brown 2 of the carrots, the celery, garlic and onion all roughly chopped, in olive oil. Add the thyme, rosemary and bay leaves. Add a whole bottle of red wine and boil for 3 minutes to remove the alcohol.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Place a large, heavy based pan on a high flame and add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. When nice and hot, take the lamb necks and season all over with salt and pepper. Place the necks in the pan and fry until dark and caramelised all over. Now place the necks in the roasting tray with the wine and vegetables. Top up with water until all of the meat is just covered, bring to the boil, and wrap tightly with two layers of tin foil. Place in the oven for about 5 hours or until the meat is extremely tender and falling apart.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>While the meat is cooking, make the mashed potato for the topping; this can be done in advance, even days before if necessary. Take the potatoes, prick each one several times with a knife and place in the oven with the lamb for 3 hours; the potatoes should be thoroughly cooked through. Remove from oven, cut in half and press the potato through a sieve into a wide-based saucepan. Now gradually add the butter whilst beating over a medium heat. The butter will emulsify into the dry, floury potato and give a luxurious silky texture. Add a splash of milk and mix thoroughly. Season generously with sea salt. Transfer into a container and set aside for later.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Remove the lamb necks and strain the braising liquid through a fine sieve into a saucepan. Bring to the boil and reduce until you have about 300ml of rich dark jus. Thicken with a little beurre manié until you have the consistency of a thin gravy. While the sauce is reducing, peel and cut the rest of the carrots into 5mm cubes, and pick the meat from the necks into rustic chunks. Fry the carrots in olive oil over a medium flame until lightly coloured. Cut the leek into 1cm squares and add to the pan. When the leeks are half-cooked, add the lamb and the sauce and gently fold, being careful not to break up the meat too much. Add a splash of Worcester sauce and season to taste with sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Pour the mixture into a baking dish and top with a thickness of about 1 inch of mashed potato. Place in the oven at 200C for about 20 minutes until golden on top</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

It was a firm favourite for us three at home especially for Rob who would devour mountains of it with lashings of tomato ketchup. We were so particular about the consistency of the sauce, being adamant that it had to be “nice and sloppy”. These days I like it a little thicker but still loose enough to be gooey and tempting, and with a nice golden gratin to give contrast in texture. One thing my parents did was to put slices of tomato on the top among the cheese. As a big fan of tomatoes, I would highly advise this. It gives a light freshness to balance the weight of all that cheese. The quality of a macaroni can be judged by the quality of it’s cheese sauce. My Dad taught me how to make perfectly smooth cheese sauce (or white sauce); he told me to add the milk to the roux in stages, and stir thoroughly each time to ensure that its totally smooth before adding more. It’s completely fail-safe and I’ve never made a lumpy cheese sauce since.

I received a delivery of half a lamb a few weeks ago to replenish my supply. All of a sudden the drawers of the freezer were happily jammed and stuffed with shoulder, leg, neck and countless chops. If I was forced to choose I would probably have to pick lamb as my favourite meat, which may seem surprising given that throughout my childhood I was nurtured and brought up on it; far from being sick of it though, I think I have a greater appreciation of good quality meat from well raised animals. My home county, Northumberland, produces more lamb than any in Britain, and some of the most delicious lamb and mutton in the world is from there. I hate to see lamb from New Zealand on the supermarket shelves when we have much better tasting stuff right here on our doorstep. The tastiest I’ve ever had was from the farm back home, and I reckon this meat is the best to be found anywhere.This is from Raymond Blanc’s Kitchen Secrets, another reliable recipe which his mother, the legendary “Maman Blanc” would have made. Rustic home cooking. It’s lamb shoulder, slow-roasted to achieve a gorgeous melting texture, and with some bones and neck chops in the bottom of the pan along with wine and herbs creating an extremely flavoursome liquid to make the sauce with. For this I reduced the liquid slightly, thickened with some beurre manié and stirred in some finely chopped mint and a splash of white wine vinegar. I served the lamb with some leek and carrot, finely sliced to mirror the flakiness of the meat, and some roasted new potatoes.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>1 1/2kg of lamb shoulder</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of thyme</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of rosemary</li>\n  <li>olive oil</li>\n  <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>3 or 4 lamb neck chops, or 700g trimmings</li>\n  <li>1 bulb of garlic</li>\n  <li>100ml of dry white wine</li>\n  <li>1 bay leaf</li>\n  <li>some beurre manie</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 230C. Take the lamb shoulder out of the fridge at least 1 hour before cooking to bring it up to room temperature. Score the lamb shoulder and rub some sea salt, black pepper and finely chopped herbs (thyme and rosemary) mixed with some olive oil into the flesh. Leave to marinate.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a roasting tray and fry lamb neck chops (or bones and trimmings) until light golden on each side, add bulb of garlic cut in half, brown for a few minutes then remove from heat. Place the shoulder on top of the bones and roast in the oven for 20mins. Meanwhile bring white wine to the boil in a small pan along with bay leaf. Add 400ml of water. Take the lamb out of the oven and add the wine mixture, scraping off any tasty sediment from the bottom of the tray. Baste the meat for a minute. Now turn the oven down to 150C, cover the meat loosely with foil and return to the oven. Roast for about 4 hours, basting every 30 minutes. The meat should be extremely tender and falling off the bone.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Use the cooking liquid to make the sauce; reduce by one third, thicken slightly with beurre manié, add a splash of white wine vinegar and some finely chopped mint.

    "content": "<p><img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/rabbit_liver_parfait.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>For years of my childhood I hated eating liver. One of our regular meals at home was a bacon and tomato pasta sauce which was finished with sautéed chicken livers. I would always baulk at the livers and have just the pasta sauce instead. The flavour has grown on me recently though and I actually love it now. Strange though I have always loved liver paté. Mum always made it at Christmas time, which we’d have on toast with chutney and salad for lunch; a really nice combination. She made it by frying the liver with bacon, adding some herbs, a splash of sherry and some cream then puréeing and leaving to set in a bowl. It was a favourite and always got finished quickly. When I was working at Blackmore’s I got introduced to chicken liver parfait. It’s a luxurious version of paté that is enriched with eggs and butter. All the ingredients are blitzed together raw, poured into a mould and cooked very gently so that the finished article is still beautifully pink. It’s really fantastic, and easily the best way to treat livers in my opinion. My brother recently acquired 18 wild rabbits from the farm at home, brought them up to Edinburgh and put them in his freezer. I went over to his house today and got a couple to make something tasty with. I also picked up all of the livers from the rabbits which he had set aside. Rabbit liver parfait! Rabbit liver has a similar consistency to chicken liver but tastes miles better. It would be perfect to make parfait with. I couldn’t find any recipes for rabbit parfait so I have used Raymond Blanc’s recipe for chicken liver parfait and adapted it slightly. I cooked it in a water bath in a cool oven to ensure that the heat transfer is gentle and we end up with a lovely pink colour. To execute this recipe properly, you will need a temperature probe, otherwise determining when the parfait is done is pretty much guess work. Because liver parfait is so rich, it needs to be garnished appropriately. Pickle or chutney is great as it has an acidic kick of vinegar which cuts through the meaty savouriness. Add some salad leaves for freshness and you have an excellent dish. Served on toast, or with delicate melba toast as I did, and you have a luxurious and delicious platter for your lunch.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>400g of rabbit livers</li>\n  <li>500ml of whole milk</li>\n  <li>100ml of port</li>\n  <li>100ml of madeira</li>\n  <li>70g of shallots, finely sliced</li>\n  <li>2 sprigs of thyme</li>\n  <li>1 clove of garlic</li>\n  <li>60g of brandy</li>\n  <li>400g of unsalted butter</li>\n  <li>2 whole eggs</li>\n  <li>2 egg yolks</li>\n  <li>sea salt</li>\n  <li>ground white pepper</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Take the livers and trim them of all sinew. Rinse several times with water, then soak in milk for 1 hour. This draws out the blood which would cause the parfait to be bitter. Meanwhile, place in a pan the port, madeira, shallots, thyme, garlic and brandy. Bring to the boil then reduce to a syrup. Set aside and leave to cool to room temperature. Carefully heat the butter so that it is melted but at room temperature. Blend the livers until smooth with the eggs and egg yolks. With the blender still running, gradually add the butter. Once everything is combined, season to taste with salt and black pepper, then pass the mixture through a fine sieve. Pour into a terrine mould or loaf tin lined with cling film, with enough cling film spare to wrap over the top. Alternatively you could pour it into small ramekins</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Pre-heat the oven to 120C. Get a roasting tin and place a folded tea towel in the bottom, this will help stop the terrine mould from sliding when placing into the oven. Put the terrine mould in and pour boiling water around to reach two-thirds of the way up, then place into the oven until the centre reaches 62C. It should take around 30 minutes but keep checking and measuring the temperature often with the probe.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Remove from the oven and place straight into the fridge to cool. Leave for several hours, preferably a whole day. To serve, cut thick slices and trim of any discoloured bits from around the edge. The parfait should be uniformly pink.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

We were in Goa and, growing tired of curry, were craving some western food for our dinner. We came upon an Italian restaurant on the edge of the beach, with plastic tables and chairs arranged under palm trees. Reputedly the pizzas and pasta were particularly good so we thought we’d give it a go. I went for ‘tomato and prawn spaghetti’ and it was absolutely delicious. It was a simple dish, using fresh tomatoes and little baby prawns. It had a really nice light sauce and was the perfect thing to eat on a hot evening, accompanied by a chilled bottle of beer! So this is my attempt at replicating that dish. It’s basically a sauce made from tomato juice, white wine and garlic, then thickened and enriched with butter. The diced tomato flesh and prawns are then simply added to heat through, just before serving. I used frozen cooked baby prawns, but if you can find fresh ones then all the better. It’s seasonal too; tomatoes are just about still good at this time of year, so make the most of it!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>3 tomatoes</li>\n  <li>200g of spaghetti</li>\n  <li>1 clove of garlic</li>\n  <li>30g of unsalted butter</li>\n  <li>180g of cooked prawns</li>\n  <li>1 handful of fresh basil leaves</li>\n  <li>sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>\n  <li>200ml of white wine</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Get a pan of salted boiling water on the go; this will be for blanching the tomatoes and cooking the spaghetti.

Peel the tomatoes, discard the skin then quarter, de-seed (reserving the pulp and seeds) and cut the flesh into small dice. Set aside the dice (this is called tomato concasse).Take the pulp and seeds, blitz in a blender and pass through a fine sieve into a saucepan.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat another saucepan over a medium heat, and add a glug of olive oil. Add the garlic and saute gently for 30 seconds. and add the wine. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk in the butter cut into small dice piece by piece, being sure to emulsify properly. Add the tomato concasse, prawns and basil. Add the spaghetti and mix everything together, making sure the pasta is nicely coated with the sauce. Taste and season with salt and freshly pepper.

The best bit about going to visit is that you get treated to her home-made bread. She makes beautiful wholegrain rolls with seeds in and treacle to make them extra dark, rich and malty. They’re the tastiest, nourishing things you could imagine. She used to make them with normal wheat flour, but in recent years she found that she has an intolerance to wheat gluten so she uses spelt flour now instead. Spelt is brilliant. It’s an ancestor of wheat that has been used for around 9000 years. It was an important crop in the development of civilisation because it thrived in poor growing conditions and was particularly resistant to disease and pests due the tough outer husk surrounding the grain. More recently it’s become redundant as preference has moved to higher-yielding varieties of wheat that are better suited to the commercial bread industry. You can still can buy spelt from some health food shops and delicatessens, which is good news because it’s absolutely delicious. As well as making bread with the flour you can make excellent risotto from whole spelt grains, as they do in a number of restaurants now. My granny doesn’t knead the dough at all, which gives a pleasing rustic consistency to the bread. She also uses fairly hot water to activate the yeast; the water shouldn’t be too hot, as this would kill the yeast, but just hand-hot (about 45C). This relatively high temperature causes the bread to rise quickly, resulting in lots of little air pockets. Her technique for baking the bread is to simply bake all of the dough into one large flat loaf, then cut it up into roll-sized portions once it has cooled. If you prefer, you could shape into individual rolls and bake them separately.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>1kg of wholegrain spelt flour</li>\n  <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>\n  <li>1 tablespoon of dried yeast</li>\n  <li>1 handful of sunflower seeds</li>\n  <li>1 handful of pumpkin seeds</li>\n  <li>1 handful of pine nuts</li>\n  <li>1 litre of water, hand-hot</li>\n  <li>2 tablespoons of black treacle</li>\n  <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Heat the oven to 200C.

Leave in a warm place to rise again for 10 minutes, then place in the oven for 20-30 minutes, until nice and brown on the top and sounding hollow when tapped underneath.

It’s a treat when she comes to visit because I always get a tin full of lovely caramely chocolatey shortbread squares. On a daily basis I’ll come home from work and, hungry, peruse the fridge for something to eat. The tin of shortbread generally gets raided whilst I’m deciding what to make for my dinner…just one piece usually ends up being two or three; needless to say the millionaire shortbread supply never lasts long! Since peanut butter and chocolate is already established as a good flavour combination it was just a small logical step to make peanut butter millionaire shortbread. I’ve been doing blog posts on Scottish ingredients and recipes, and shortbread is definitely a Scottish thing so I suppose at a stretch this is a Scottish recipe. On flicking through my recipe books, I picked up some tips on how to make shortbread. Although simple, it’s important to make it carefully so as not to end up with a poor result. When mixing the ingredients it’s vital to not overwork as the butter will begin to melt; then when it cooks it’ll be hard instead of the soft, melt-in-the-mouth consistency you’re looking for. Marcus Wareing suggests finely grating the chilled butter when making shortbread, then you hardly have to work the mixture with your hands and the butter barely softens at all. The result is excellent.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>270g of plain flour</li>\n  <li>80g of caster sugar</li>\n  <li>220g of unsalted butter</li>\n  <li>150g of condensed milk</li>\n  <li>50g of golden syrup</li>\n  <li>150g of smooth peanut butter</li>\n  <li>200g of milk chocolate, or dark chocolate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>First make the shortbread: in a large mixing bowl, place 270g flour, 80g caster sugar, a pinch of salt and 180g of chilled and finely grated unsalted butter. Lightly rub the mixture together with your hands until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Line a 20cm x 30cm baking tray with greaseproof paper and press the shortbread mixture into it. Place in the fridge for about an hour. Preheat the oven to 160C and bake for 40mins or until light golden in colour.

Simmer for 5 minutes whilst stirring constantly with a spatula; this thickens the caramel making it set firm when cooled. Pour onto the shortbread and spread evenly. Put in a cool place to set. To finish, melt 200g of milk or dark chocolate and pour over the caramel shortbread once it has cooled. Leave again to cool, then cut into squares.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

My mum makes blackcurrant cordial from hoards of blackcurrant bushes we have back home and it’s fantastic. She puts it in empty Ribena bottles and it’s indistinguishable from the genuine article! I’ve always loved Ribena, and although blackcurrant cordial is quite readily available I’ve never come across a raspberry version. So here it is; the sweet taste of summer in a bottle. A basic fruit cordial consists of fruit, sugar and water. My first attempt was simply to make a sugar syrup, add the raspberry puree and bring to the boil. The result was excellent, yielding a really fresh raspberry flavour. When I subsequently did some research online, I found that most of the recipes for fruit cordial involved heating the sugar water and fruit together and simmering for 10 minutes or so before allowing to cool and bottling. I tried a second batch using this method, also adding some lemon juice and peel for a extra dimension in flavour, and although the flavour was good it was not as fresh as the first method which didn’t involve cooking the fruit for as long. In addition I think it tasted better without the lemon; I believe the amazing flavour of fresh raspberries should be allowed to shine without hindrance. This is simple, unadorned raspberry flavour!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>550g of raspberries</li>\n  <li>400ml of water</li>\n  <li>350g of caster sugar</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Puree raspberries by placing them in a blender, blitzing until smooth then passing through a fine sieve to remove the seeds.

Turn off the heat, and skim off any scum that has risen to the surface. Pass once more through a fine sieve, allow to cool, then store in sterilised bottles.</li>\n</ol>\n\n",

Now settled in and enjoying the comforts of a nice flat with a better equipped kitchen than the last one (the kitchen is, after all, the most important room in any house) I am set to get blogging again. I’m very aware that there’s a lack of sweet things on this blog. I must make amends. Also, I had an idea to do a series of recipes involving quintessential Scottish ingredients…such as raspberries! This is a replication of the brownies that Marc made at Wedgwood last week; I used Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall’s basic brownie recipe as a basis. For chocoholics this is a truly indulgent affair, and combined with a gorge of fresh summer fruit in the form of juicy raspberries it’s brilliant. A fantastic marriage of flavours. The brownie should be shiny and cracked on top, hiding the heavenly soft centre which any brownie lover craves.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>150g of Scottish raspberries</li>\n  <li>icing sugar, to taste</li>\n  <li>170g of butter</li>\n  <li>200g of caster sugar</li>\n  <li>100g of light brown muscovado sugar</li>\n  <li>3 whole eggs</li>\n  <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>\n  <li>100g of cocoa powder</li>\n  <li>50g of plain flour</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 160C/Gas 3. Grease a 22x22x5cm brownie tin and line with two strips of baking parchment, letting the sides hang over the edge to make removing the brownies easier. Firstly, prepare the raspberries: place the raspberries in a blender and puree. Sweeten to taste with icing sugar. Pass the mixture through a sieve to remove the seeds. Set aside.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Place the butter in a saucepan and melt over a medium heat until it turns brown and develops a nutty aroma. Set aside to cool. Using an electric hand mixer, beat together the caster sugar, light muscovado sugar and eggs until thick and glossy. The ribbon of batter should be visible on the surface for several seconds when you lift up the whisk. Beat in the vanilla extract and the browned butter. Sift the cocoa powder and plain flour into a separate bowl. Gently fold this into the egg mixture with a spatula. Scrape about half of the mixture into the prepared tin, then spoon dollops of the raspberry puree on top. Scrape the rest of the brownie mix on top, and stir the mixture slightly to create a marble effect. Place in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out of the middle of the brownies with a few moist crumbs attached.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n",

I admit that I’m a bit of a novice when it comes to fish as I don’t often cook it, although I do love eating it. I recently invested in a copy of the River Cottage Fish Book which has provided a good bit of inspiration. Flicking through it the other day, a photo of salmon tartare grabbed my attention. Since making steak tartare recently and appreciating it’s beautiful simplicity, salmon tartare obviously appealed to me. Steak tartare is a celebration of well-aged, tender beef that is full of flavour. Salmon tartare is much the same: the piece of fish used must be top quality and as fresh as possible. Finding such a piece of fish was not going to be a problem in Edinburgh, and was particularly easy for me asArmstrong’s fishmongers, recognized by many as the best in the city, happens to be just down the road from my flat. “All of this was fresh this morning” he assured me when I told him I needed a piece of salmon as fresh as possible. On slicing it was clearly very fresh, the orange-pink flesh glossy and firm. Tasting it as it was, pure and unadorned, it already had excellent flavour. Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall uses Tabasco and Worcester sauce in his recipe which I chose to omit here as I think the amazing flavour of the fish shouldn’t be masked too much by additives. My version of the dish, I believe, includes enough extra ingredients to compliment and enhance the natural flavour of the fish without overpowering it. One of my favourite things about this dish is the magic worked by the lemon juice. As well as imparting sharp fresh flavour, the acid in the lemon juice affects the protein in the fish, causing a “cooked” texture on the surface of the meat. The acid denatures the protein molecules just as heat does when cooking, and as the brine did in my pig’s cheeks recipe. Pickling things in vinegar, again, has the same denaturing effect. All of these in a sense are just different ways of cooking meat. The advantage of using a method like this is that the fresh flavour of the raw meat does not change nearly as much as if you cooked it. The salmon will continue to “cook” for as long as it is left to marinate in the lemon juice. I would recommend no more than 5 minutes; this will result in a fairly thin layer of cooked-texture meat surrounding a lovely soft rare centre.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>1 teaspoon of shallots, finely chopped</li>\n  <li>1 teaspoon of parsley, finely chopped</li>\n  <li>1 teaspoon of chives, finely chopped</li>\n  <li>1 teaspoon of gherkins, finely chopped</li>\n  <li>1 teaspoon of lemon juice, freshly squeezed</li>\n  <li>sea salt</li>\n  <li>freshly cracked black pepper</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Remove the skin from the salmon and cut out the grey coloured blood line so you have only the shiny pink flesh. Cut into approximate 1cm dice and place in a bowl. Add shallots, parsley, chives, gherkins and lemon juice, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Mix well, taste and adjust the quantities and seasoning if need be. There are no exact quantities for this, just experiment and find out what works best for you. Leave to</li>\n</ol>\n\n",

It’s a proper hearty winter warmer of a dish, and pretty much a meal in itself as it is so thick and substantial. I made this soup with meat from the braised breast and stock that I made from the mutton bones. You could instead use leftover meat from a mutton or lamb roast, along with chicken stock from powder if you don’t want to make stock from scratch. The mutton could also be substituted quite satisfactorily with chicken; get some chicken thighs, season and toss in olive oil and roast on gas mark 7 for about 30 minutes. Then just pick off the meat and substitute into the recipe below accordingly. I used braised breast, but you could just as well use another cut such as scruffy chops, belly or neck chops. If you do braise some meat, you could use the braising liquor instead of making stock, although it will taste quite strongly of wine (if you use my recipe below) which you may not want in the soup. I believe the rich mellow flavour obtained from the slowly cooked stock is preferable in this case.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>150g of streaky bacon</li>\n  <li>1 onion</li>\n  <li>2 sticks of celery</li>\n  <li>3 large cloves of garlic</li>\n  <li>1/2 teaspoon of mutton fat, reserved from the stock</li>\n  <li>2 carrots, cut into 5mm dice</li>\n  <li>300g of braised mutton, cut into bitesized pieces</li>\n  <li>1 1/2 teaspoon of madras curry powder</li>\n  <li>1/4 teaspoon of paprika</li>\n  <li>1 litre of mutton stock</li>\n  <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>a few drops of worcester sauce</li>\n  <li>1 teaspoon  of white wine vinegar</li>\n  <li>1 handful of flat leaf parsley</li>\n  <li>300g of potatoes, cut into 1cm dice</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Cut the bacon into thin lardons and fry in a little olive oil in a large pot until just starting to colour.

Turn the heat right down and gently sweat the vegetables down for 10-15 minutes until they are nice and soft. Add to the pot the carrots, braised mutton, curry powder, paprika and stock. Taste and season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper, bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to just below simmering point and cook for 15-20 minutes. Add a few drops of Worcester sauce and 1 teaspoon of white wine vinegar. Add the potato dice and cook until the potatoes are tender but not falling apart. Adjust the seasoning and serve with some roughly chopped parsley scattered over.</li>\n</ol>\n\n",

When I was little I always looked forward to Shrove Tuesday because it was pancake day! Dinner consisted of as many pancakes as you could possibly eat, accompanied by a variety of fillings. The most popular, and an all-time classic was sugar and lemon juice. Simple and delicious; hard to beat. Other household favourites were bolognese sauce; maple syrup; and – I think it deserves a mention, although I realise that this will cause severe discontent among some – Marmite. “Crazy talk!” I hear you say, but if you (like me) are not a hater but a lover, put some Marmite on your pancake along with some butter, it’s fantastic. The final addition to my list of classic and favourite fillings is a relatively new one for me. My friend Richard, a fellow pancake obsessive, is an advocate for butter and sugar being the all-time best pancake filler. I was surprised that I had never before thought of this combination, they are two ingredients that almost everyone is bound to have in their house, and it’s a winner. So if you make pancakes you must try it. Make sure you use plenty of butter; fry the pancake in butter and put more butter on after flipping and before adding plenty of granulated sugar. Sweet buttery goodness. Lovely.Today I decided to have a break from tradition and try some new fillings. I found in my fridge some smoked salmon, crème fraîche and spinach… I waved my magic wand and very soon I had two delicious pancake fillings ready to be married in tasty happiness to some beautiful crêpes.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>3 eggs</li>\n  <li>250g of plain flour</li>\n  <li>450ml of whole milk</li>\n  <li>1 pinch of salt</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl, add the flour, a splash of milk and salt. Mix until a uniform consistency is achieved. Now add milk in stages, mixing to get a smooth texture in between each stage. Let the batter stand for 2 hours before cooking; this allows any air in the mixture to dissipate, ensuring that the pancakes do not rise when cooking and stay nice and flat. Thin the batter just before cooking with 50-100ml of milk. To cook the pancakes, get your frying pan nice and hot before adding a knob of butter. Once the butter has melted, pour in a small amount of batter whilst carefully tilting the pan to ensure that a nice thin even spread is achieved. Fry for a few minutes on each side, until nice and golden.</li>\n</ol>\n\n",

However, bolognese sauce can often turn out mediocre if thrown together in a hurry and without much thought. My philosophy for making a good bolognese rests on two principles. One: it should be really meaty, and two: it should simmer gently for a long time to tenderise the meat. My usual bolognese contains beef mince, pork mince, bacon, and pork sausage meat. This gives a nice combination of meaty flavours. It’s nice to vary things though, and I sometimes combine the beef mince with lamb or venison mince. Another thing about my bolognese, which is slightly controversial, is that I omit tomatoes and only include tomato puree. The main liquid component of the sauce instead comes from beef or pork stock, which promotes a richer meat flavour. This is an easy reliable meal, and a great one to serve if you have guests since just about everyone likes spaghetti bolognese! I usually make a big quantity, then freeze most of it before adding the cream.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>150g of streaky bacon</li>\n  <li>2 onions</li>\n  <li>3 large  cloves of garlic</li>\n  <li>1 stick of celery</li>\n  <li>2 carrots</li>\n  <li>500g of beef mince</li>\n  <li>500g of pork mince</li>\n  <li>250g of good quality sausage meat</li>\n  <li>5 tablespoons of tomato puree</li>\n  <li>200ml of white wine</li>\n  <li>300ml of beef stock</li>\n  <li>sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>1 sprig of thyme</li>\n  <li>1 bay leaf</li>\n  <li>3 tablespoons of double cream</li>\n  <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>\n  <li>parmesan cheese, to serve</li>\n  <li>600g of spaghetti</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Chop the bacon into small lardons and fry in a couple of tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan.

Now add the rest of the meat and turn the heat up; stir constantly until all the meat is browned and well mixed. Add the tomato puree, wine and stock, along with a good pinch of cracked black pepper, the thyme and bay leaf. Bring to the boil, then leave barely simmering, uncovered, for about 2 hours, or until the mince is very tender and the sauce is intense and rich. If need be, add more stock if the sauce is looking too dry. Taste, and season. Just before serving, stir in the double cream.

Although I was pleased with the last lot, I was slightly annoyed by the fact I had to soak it in water to reduce the saltiness, as the flavour from the rosemary, sugar and black peppercorns will have also been reduced. Whilst browsing the River Cottage forums one day, I read about other people who had had the same problem when following Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall’s recipe for dry cure bacon. There was one person, Howard, who had done alot of research and looked at several different recipes before he tried curing his bacon, and said it turned out beautifully. So I decided to follow his guidelines. I love making bacon. Such a simple procedure, with such amazing results. It’s quite comforting to have a load of delicious streaky bacon sitting in my fridge, waiting to be turned into something tasty. Again, I got a hold of a whole pork belly (I don’t like to do things by half), but it wasn’t all for me; the other chefs Marc, Marcus and Alan from work were going to split the cost with me for a piece of bacony loveliness. I was more adventurous with the flavourings this time; nutmeg and rosemary were the primary notes, with undertones from a few other spices also coming through. I did actually end up soaking the bacon, but only for 1 hour this time, so the extra flavours were still noticeable in the finished bacon. I didn’t manage to get a hold of any salt petre unfortunately, so the bacon won’t keep its pinkness when cooked. The flavour will be unaffected though, which is the main thing. I’m very happy with the end product; I have delicious things in store for it. It was a source of comfort and joy to have my bacon hanging up in the kitchen, slowly maturing and increasing in firmness and flavour. Everyone should try making bacon, it’s so easy, and you will have a product which is many miles better than anything you can get in a supermarket.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<ul>\n  <li>5kg of pork belly</li>\n  <li>300g of salt</li>\n  <li>100g of soft brown sugar</li>\n  <li>1 tablespoon of cracked black pepper</li>\n  <li>6 bay leaves, finely chopped</li>\n  <li>3 sprigs of rosemary, finely chopped</li>\n  <li>1/2 teaspoons of ground mace</li>\n  <li>6 allspice berries, ground</li>\n  <li>3 cloves, ground</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Mix all the ingredients except the pork together in a bowl.

Finally, wrap it in muslin and hang for a week in a cool larder to dry and allow the flavour to mature.</li>\n</ol>\n\n",

It can be deceptively tricky to perfect however; too much heat when adding the eggs can result in scrambling them instead of gently cooking them to get the desired silky smooth sauce. My favourite way to have this meal is to make the sauce fairly runny, so that a lovely gooey creamy sauce collects at the bottom of your bowl. Each forkfull can then be stirred through this sauce to get it well coated before shoving it in your mouth with gusto, licking your lips and greedily going for another mouthful.

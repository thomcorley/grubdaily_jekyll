        <title>Chicken and Coriander Broth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/chicken_and_coriander_broth.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was clearing out my fridge a few weeks ago and came across a selection of root vegetables lurking there, waiting to be turned into something tasty. The first thing that came to my mind was soup, and since we were in the middle of winter I was thinking along the lines of a chunky, meaty broth. I decided on Chicken, which would provide my soup with both the chunky meat component and the stock. A bunch of fresh coriander which also happened to be in my fridge could be involved here in some way, I thought. I remembered a Madhur Jaffrey recipe for coriander chicken curry, involving large quantities of fresh coriander, resulting in a vibrant green curry sauce. It was fantastic, and so I reckoned it could work in my soup too. The earthiness of all those root vegetables would be balanced by the fresh zing of the coriander, perhaps. I prepared the chicken in my usual way; removed the breasts, then cut up the remaining carcass into small pieces and fried until nicely caramelised for the stock. This time I actually chopped up the wings and legs too and added them to the stock for extra flavour. Once the stock was almost ready, after an hour or so, I took some out to gently poach the breast meat in a separate pan. Once perfectly barely cooked, I allowed them to cool before carefully cutting them into dice. All the vegetables and chicken diced to the same size, making for an attractive looking bowl of broth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 free range chicken&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 carrot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 onion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 stick of celery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 leek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 cloves of garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon of coriander seeds, crushed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 black peppercorns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;150ml of dry sherry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;150ml of red wine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;75g of unsalted butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chicken breasts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;150g of carrot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;150g of swede&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;150g of celeriac&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 onion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 large cloves of garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 large bunch of coriander&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vegetable oil, for frying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove the breasts from the chicken and set aside. Chop the remaining carcass, including the legs and wings, into small pieces. Cut all the vegetables into approx. 1cm dice, set aside. Get a large heavy based pan on a high heat and colour the bones in 2 batches until golden and caramelised. Add a knob of butter at the end of each batch and foam for a few minutes, to enrich and brown the bones further, then drain the butter off in a colander. Add the vegetables, the garlic, coriander seeds and peppercorns to the same pan, which should have some dark intense residue stuck to the bottom, and sweat gently for about 15- 20 minutes, until soft and sweet. All the tasty chicken residue should have melted into the vegetables. Put the chicken bones back into the pan, and add the sherry and red wine. Reduce the alcohol until completely dry, then cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, skimming any fat and scum that rises. Simmer gently for 2 hours, skimming frequently. Pass through a fine sieve and set aside.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the stock is almost ready, ladle some out into a small pan and gently poach the chicken breasts, just covered with hot stock but not boiling, turning the breasts every few minutes. Remove when they are just barely cooked, and allow to cool. While the stock is cooking, prepare the vegetables for the broth: cut the carrot, celeriac, swede and onion into 5mm dice, and finely chop the garlic. Sweat the onion and garlic in vegetable oil for about 5 minutes, until soft. Add the carrot and cook for about 5 minutes, add the swede and cook for a further 2 minutes, then finally add the celeriac. Sweat until all the veg is nicely cooked, then remove from the heat. Cut the cooked chicken breast into 5mm dice and set aside. When the stock is ready, season to taste with salt and pour just enough over the diced vegetables, ensuring to leave it nice and thick. You may have some leftover. Add the chicken dice and gently warm through. Finally chop the coriander and stir through at the very end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Pork Belly, Asparagus and Ale Sauce</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/pork_belly_asparagus_and_ale_sauce.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The belly has long been my favourite part of the pig. There are two things I generally prefer to do with a pork belly; either salt it and cure it to make dry-cured bacon, or braise it long and slow, for about 12 hours, then press and chill it before roasting it until crispy. Pork belly cooked this way has the most amazing mouthfeel; the meat itself is succulent and has fat running through the layers that melts in your mouth, and the skin that sits atop is the most fantastic crisp pork crackling. It’s a great contrast of textures!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 1/2kg of pork belly, skin on, bones removed but reserved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200g of pork trimmings, diced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 rashers of smoked streaky bacon, diced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 sprigs of thyme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fine sea salt, or table salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sprig of sage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sea salt and cracked black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;400ml of medium dark ale&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 carrot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 leek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 onion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tomato&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 bulb of garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 litre of chicken stock, unseasoned&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;20g of unsalted butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a little beurre manie&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 spring cabbage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200g of baby spinach&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;20 spears of medium asparagus, points removed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heat the oven to 140C. To cook the pork belly, season it with 1 heaped teaspoon of fine salt and rub it into the flesh and skin side. Line a roasting tray that just fits it in snugly with greaseproof paper, and add water until just covered. Add a sprig of thyme and a few sage leaves, then place in the oven for 10-12 hours, until it is absolutely tender and almost falling apart when touching it with a spoon. Remove the liquid from the tray, and set aside. Now cover the belly with another sheet of greaseproof paper and press with another tray on top, followed by a heavy weight (2-3kg). Place in the fridge to chill for at least 6 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make the pork and ale sauce; take the reserved bones from the belly and cut into small pieces using a cleaver or a heavy pair of scissors. Cut the carrot, leek, onion and tomato into approx 1cm dice, and set aside. Lightly crush the garlic. In a large, heavy based pan, heat about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over a high heat. Saute the bones until golden, then strain in a colander. Reduce the heat to medium, and in the same pan, cook the vegetables with a generous pinch of salt for about 10 minutes. Add the pork bones back in, along with the rest of the thyme and a few sage leaves. Add the ale, and bring to the boil. Reduce until the liquid is completely gone, then add the reserved cooking liquid from the pork belly. Bring to the boil, and reduce until dry again. Add enough chicken stock until just covered, then simmer gently for 30 minutes. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve, and reduce by half, or until you have an intense flavour. Whisk in some beurre manie to thicken, adding just a little bit at a time. Set the sauce aside.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heat the oven to 180C. Portion the pork belly into 4 equal sized pieces, and score the skin carefully in a criss-cross pattern. Add 3-4 tablespoons of vegetable oil to a large heavy based pan (with an oven-proof handle), then add the pork skin side down and place over a high heat. When it just starts to sizzle, place in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the skin is golden and very crispy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the pork belly is cooking, prepare the vegetables; fill a large pot with water and season generously with salt. Bring to the boil. Cut off the bottom 1-2 cm of the asparagus as it is woody and tough. Remove the outer 2 or 3 layers of the cabbage, and cut out the thick veins. Slice coarsely. Wash the baby spinach leaves, then set aside. When the pork belly is about 5 minutes away from finished, heat the butter in a large saute pan until foaming, then add the cabbage along with a pinch of salt. Cook until tender. Cook the asparagus in the boiling salted water until just tender - about 4 minutes. Finally, add the baby spinach to the pan with the cabbage and cook until wilted. Serve the pork belly on the bed of vegetables, and pour the sauce over.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Pasta Puttanesca</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/pasta_puttanesca.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just received a slow cooker as a birthday present from my good friend Lewis, its fantastic because it allows me to braise meat and stews for a long time without having to be in the house. When I’m working all day I can have my dinner slowly cooking for when I get back. I make tomato sauce with the slow cooker; tinned tomatoes, onion, garlic, and tomato puree simmered gently for several hours until it is dark and reduced. I then puree and pass it through a fine sieve to make it extra smooth. What you get is an amazingly rich dark red sauce. This can be used for any number of things, but my current favourite is to make salty pungent puttanesca with it. This sauce is accompanied by spaghetti; literally “whore’s style spaghetti”, it’s packed with in-your-face flavours. Traditionally made with tomatoes, garlic, black olives, anchovies and capers, it’s salty and more-ish. It’s a good dish to have in your repertoire; because it’s made almost entirely with store cupboard ingredients it can be rustled up with just a moment’s notice, although in my recipe the tomato sauce is simmered for eight hours to make it extra rich. This isn’t essential but will make your sauce taste amazing. I recommend making a big batch of sauce and freezing it. As there are so many big and bold flavours going on here, I have added a good handful of parsley and basil to bring some freshness to the dish and vital splash of green, making it particularly eye-catching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 400g tins of peeled plum tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons of tomato puree&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 onion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 large cloves of garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 glass of red wine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extra virgin olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon of sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 large handful of pitted black olives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 anchovy fillets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 large bunch of flat leaf parsley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 handful  of basil leaves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;400g of tagliatelle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make the tomato sauce; finely slice the onion and sweat in a couple of glugs of olive oil with a generous pinch of salt until the onions are completely softened. Now finely chop the garlic cloves and add to the pot along with the tomatoes, tomato puree, sugar and red wine. Bring to the boil, then gently simmer for about 8 hours until the sauce is rich and dark. Puree the sauce in a blender and pass through a fine sieve. it should be fairly thick so that it coats the pasta nicely. If it’s too thin, simmer it gently to reduce further. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cook your pasta according to the packet instructions while you finish the sauce: finely chop the anchovy fillets and gently fry in a little olive oil until they start to disintegrate, then add the tomato sauce and stir. Slice the olives and add to the sauce. Finely chop the parsley and roughly chop the basil and add to the sauce at the very end. When the pasta is ready, stir the sauce in; add just enough to coat the pasta nicely, it should be really thick. Serve with some red wine and crusy bread. Fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Arbroath Smoky</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/arbroath_smoky.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a coastline as extensive and diverse as Scotland’s, it’s not surprising that seafood is so popular here. The process of salting and smoking fish was originally a method of preserving the fish to enable long storage. Although not necessary as a means of survival anymore, smoked fish - salmon and haddock in particular - is commonly enjoyed all over the country because it’s simply delicious! I recently had great pleasure in making Cullen Skink - the traditional Scottish soup made with smoked haddock - but since it has been so warm recently I wanted to do something a bit less hearty and filling. Some sort of salad seemed like the best thing to do, so I just warmed the fish gently in some milk, and flaked it over a simple salad of baby spinach, spring onions and courgette sliced thinly into ribbons. Topped finally with a poached egg, simple but delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 arbroath smokies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 eggs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;60g of baby spinach leaves, washed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 courgette&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 spring onions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extra virgin olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sea salt and cracked black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 lemon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200ml of whole milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil. Turn down to a barely trembling simmer and leave. Place the smokies in a wide based pan and cover with the milk. Poach gently, not boiling, turning the fish frequently, until just warmed through. Set aside.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thinly slice the onions at an angle, then place in a large mixing bowl along with the spinach. Season with olive oil, salt and pepper and a little squeeze of lemon juice. Cut the courgette into quarters lengthways and cut out the soft pulp from the middle. Carefully cut into long ribbons. Season with sea salt and olive oil, then add to the bowl of salad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Carefully poach the eggs until just cooked. While the eggs are cooking, arrange the salad into 4 bowls. Flake the smoked fish over the top, and finish with the poached eggs, seasoning with a little salt and pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Roast Pork Fillet, Grain Mustard Sauce</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/roast_pork_fillet_grain_mustard_sauce.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pork fillets are easily obtainable and relatively inexpensive, but the best thing about them is they usually come with trimmings attached to them which must be removed before cooking; and with these trimmings you can make a quick and delicious homemade sauce with no pre-made stocks or artificial seasoning. Just simple fresh ingredients. This recipe is one of the easiest and most delicious things to do with a pork fillet, and personal favourite of mine. Grain mustard is a classic pairing for pork, and combined with creamy mashed potatoes and cabbage, it’s an absolute winner!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 pork fillets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 savoy cabbage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50ml of double cream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 Maris Piper potatoes, or King Edward&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;65g of unsalted butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30ml of whole milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sea salt and cracked black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ground white pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 cloves of garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 shallots&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 sprigs of thyme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 bay leaf&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sprig of sage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;100ml of cooking brandy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon of wholegrain mustard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vegetable oil, for cooking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heat the oven to 170C. Prick the potatoes with a skewer, then place in the oven for about 1hr 30mins, until soft and cooked through. Cut the potatoes in half, then scoop the potato from the skins and either mash with a masher or pass through a sieve. Place into a wide-based pan, and over a medium-low heat, add ½ teaspoon of salt, and mix. Add 30g of the butter, one dice at a time, then add the milk. Continue to cook out until you have a completely smooth, silky texture. Adjust the seasoning with salt and white pepper if need be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While you’re waiting for the potatoes, make the sauce: trim the pork fillets of all sinew, and cut off the small head or “chateau” from the end. Cut all the trimmings approximately 1cm dice. In a large, heavy-based pan, heat 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over a high heat. Season the trimmings with salt and black pepper, then fry until golden all over, and strain in a colander. Meanwhile, thinly slice the shallots, and crush the clove of garlic. Add the shallots, thyme, bay, sage and garlic to the same pan and turn the heat to medium. Add a pinch of salt, and gently cook the shallots for about 10 minutes, until they are soft. Add the pork trimmings back to the pan, along with the brandy. Boil, and reduce until completely dry. Now cover with cold water, and boil to reduce until dry. Repeat this 3 times, but on the last time, only reduce by half, then strain the sauce into a separate pan. Add the cream, and continue to reduce until you have a nice sauce consistency. Lastly, add the mustard, and mix.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To cook the pork fillet: heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large heavy-based pan over a high heat. Season the fillets all over with salt and white pepper. Fry the fillets all over until golden and caramelised. Place the pan in the oven for 3 minutes. Remove from the oven, and add the remaining 25g butter. Heat until foaming, then add 1 sprig of thyme and 1 crushed clove of garlic. Baste the pork fillet for about 2 minutes, turning over after 1 minute. Cook until the pork is still slightly pink in the middle. Transfer to a rack and leave in a warm place to rest for at least 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prepare the cabbage: Remove and discard the dark green outer layers. Take the inner leaves off and remove the woody veins. Thinly slice the cabbage, then set aside. Heat a little vegetable oil in a wide-based pan over a medium-high heat, and saute the cabbage, with a pinch of salt, until lightly coloured. Turn the heat to low, then add the remaining 10g of butter. Cook gently until cabbage is tender taste, and add more salt if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To serve, place a spoonful of the mashed potato in the centre of the plate, with a spoonful of cabbage next to it. Slice the pork fillet, and place on top. Spoon the sauce over.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Crab Salad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/crab_salad.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the delicious things in the world to eat, crab is easily one of my favourites. It’s got an intense flavour of the sea and it’s succulent, sweet and juicy. In short, it’s fantastic. Preparing crab involves a bit of work and is fairly time consuming… but it’s a labour of love and something I’d urge everyone to try. Cooked in generously seasoned water, the beautiful white meat is excellent whilst still warm, eaten straight from the shell. It hardly needs anything more, although mix it with a little mayonnaise, herbs and lemon juice and you have the beginnings of a delicious salad. I’ve been wanting to write a crab recipe for a while now, but found it difficult to think of a really photogenic looking dish that wasn’t just a rip-off from one of the restaurants I’ve worked in. The custard part of this dish is similar to a crab creme brulee that we did at Wedgwood, and it’s really tasty. The sweet flavour of crab infuses really well in cream, and the fresh herbs added at the end finish it off beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 brown crab&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 carrot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 leek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 fennel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 star anise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 thyme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;600ml of whipping cream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50ml of whole milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 parsley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 dill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tarragon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 baby gem lettuce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 spring onion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 chives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 pieces of medium sliced white bread&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 egg yolks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cayenne pepper, or piment d’espelette&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon of mayonnaise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons of croutons&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lemon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil. Season generously with salt (it should be almost as salty as the sea.) Drop the crab in the water, bring back to the boil, remove from the heat and allow to cool for at least 40 minutes. Remove the crab from the water, and place on a tray.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Break off the claws, and smash them carefully with a hammer or large knife, trying not to smash into too many small pieces. Separate the meat from the shell, trying to keep it in nice big chunks. Repeat the process with the legs. Now prise the body from the main shell of the crab, and remove and discard the lungs (“dead man’s fingers”). Cut the body in half and carefully scrape out the meat with a crab picker or use the handle of a teaspoon. Cut the pieces in half again and scrape more out - you’ll be surprised how much is hidden in all the cavities. Carefully check the crab meat for pieces of shell, cover and place in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heat the oven to 200C. Place a roasting tray in the oven until very hot, then add 3-4 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Smash all the crab shell into small pieces with a heavy knife or rolling pin, then place in the roasting tray. Stir once, then return to the oven for 30 minutes, stirring halfway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, thinly slice all the vegetables, keeping the carrots separate. In a large pot, fry the carrots and star anise in a little vegetable oil with a generous pinch of salt, until lightly coloured. Add the rest of the vegetables and sweat over a medium heat for about 20 minutes.The shells should be lightly coloured. Deglaze the tray with the white wine, and reduce until dry. Add the shells to the pot of vegetables, and the tomato, roughly chopped. Add the cream to the pot, and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 30 minutes, then roughly chop the herbs (reserving some chives and dill for the salad) and add to the pot. Cover with clingfilm and leave to infuse for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pass the crab cream through a fine sieve, rinsing the shell pulp with the milk. Discard the pulp. Taste the cream and adjust the seasoning if it needs. Weigh the cream, and then place 1 egg yolk for every 100g of cream in a separate pan. Boil the cream, then pour slowly over the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Now heat the crab custard over a low heat, stirring constantly with a plastic spatula to ensure it doesn’t stick. When it is thick, and coats the back of the spatula (should be 80C), it is ready. Pour into 6 wide creme brulee dishes, filling only to 2mm deep. You may have some custard left over which you can just set in separate ramekins to be enjoyed on their own. Place the ramekins in the fridge to set, for at least two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make the crab salad: finely slice the lettuce and the spring onion, cut the reserved chives and pick the dill into fronds. Place everything in a bowl with the picked crab meat, the croutons and add just enough mayonnaise to lightly bind it together; you may not need all of it, it depends on how much crab meat you have. Season with sea salt if it needs, and lemon juice. Divide the mixture into 6 and place in the middle of the custard ramekins. Finally sprinkle over a little cayenne pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Roasted Mushroom Soup</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/roasted_mushroom_soup.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have long been an advocate of the humble button mushroom. It’s one of these ingredients that’s so commonplace, I reckon it’s not appreciated to its full potential. A staple in your greasy breakfast fry-up, or as a mediocre ‘cream of mushroom soup’, the button mushroom is actually so much better that you might realise. They are high in umami – the taste that makes things savory – and they have a lot of powerful flavour locked inside. One of their characteristics is that they have an extremely high water content, making the flavour rather bland until you have reduced the moisture. I’ve also found that when you fry them in a hot pan with a pinch of salt until they’re dark and caramelised, the flavour is amazingly intense and savory. This is what gave me the idea of doing a roast mushroom soup. It’d be better than the average mushroom soup as it would be a rich golden colour, instead of grey, and the resulting flavour would be all the more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;450g of baby button mushrooms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 onion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 cloves of garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 rashers  of streaky bacon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 sprigs of rosemary&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 1/2litres of chicken stock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons of sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 tablespoons of olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set 12 mushrooms aside, and slice the rest of them in half. Sprinkle the halved mushrooms with the sea salt so they’re evenly covered, then place in a colander set over a bowl. Leave in the fridge for about 6 hours, or overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heat the oven to 180C, and put a medium sized roasting tray in to heat up. Briefly rinse the mushrooms with cold water, then squeeze them with your hands to remove as much moisture as possible. Pat them dry with kitchen paper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in the roasting tray, then add the mushrooms along with 2 sprigs of rosemary. Roast the mushrooms, tossing occasionally, until they are dark and caramelised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion and garlic, and dice the bacon. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium pot and fry the bacon over a high heat until crisp. Turn the heat down and sweat the onion and garlic slowly for about 20 minutes, until soft and sweet. Once the mushrooms are nicely coloured, remove the rosemary from the roasting tray and add the mushrooms to the pan of onions. Add about 1 litre of chicken stock - enough to just cover the mushrooms - and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover with a lid, and simmer for 30 minutes, topping up with chicken stock when it reduces too much.Blend the soup in a food processor on full power for 5 minutes, until you have a silky smooth texture. You may need to add a little more stock to get the required consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To finish; slice the 12 reserved mushrooms in half, season with salt and saute them to get a nice roasted colour. Pick the leaves from the remaining rosemary sprig and fry these in olive oil until just crisp. Scatter the mushrooms and rosemary over the soup along with a drizzle of olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Aubergine, Tomato, Parmesan</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/aubergine_tomato_parmesan.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melanzane alla Parmigiana is a classic Italian dish of fried aubergines, tomato and parmesan, a bit like a lasagne but with aubergines instead of pasta. And it is delicious! Superior to lasagne in my opinion, if I had to choose between the two, melanzane  would win hands down. It’s so hot today I have opened all the windows and there is a warm breeze blowing through the room. The weather puts me in the mood for a salad, and thinking about this dish gave me the idea of doing a salad version of it, with crispy aubergine slices, fresh tomatoes and shavings of parmesan. The thought of it has my mouth watering already..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 aubergine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;20g of parmesan, shaved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cracked black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 handful of basil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extra virgin olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;balsamic vinegar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make crispy aubergine slices, you need to remove most of the water from the aubergine. It’s like a sponge, and holds a lot of moisture. Slice them and salt them to draw it out. This way they will go nice and crisp when you bake them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heat the oven to 180C. Gently squeeze out the liquid from the aubergine slices, being careful not to break them. Arrange them on a baking tray and flatten them out. Sprinkle with a little black pepper, but no salt. Drizzle with olive oil and bake in the oven for about 15 minutes, turning them over halfway, until they are golden and crisp. Remove from the oven and leave to drain on some kitchen paper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To assemble the salad: slice the tomato into 2mm slices and season each slice with sea salt, cracked black pepper and olive oil. Arrange the aubergine slices alternating with the tomato as shown in the photo. Garnish with basil leaves, parmesan shavings and balsamic vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has to be the quintessential Scottish dessert. Comprising almost entirely of classic Scottish produce; raspberries, porridge oats, honey and Scotch whisky, they are flavours that compliment eachother perfectly. You can’t really go wrong here in terms of method and quantities, if you just throw all of it together in a bowl and mix, you couldn’t fail to end up with something delicious. Normally though, the cream is whipped to form soft-peaks to provide some body and texture. Also I have crushed some of the raspberries with honey to make a kind of sauce, and also cooked the oats with the honey to form crunchy clusters which give some bite when folded through the cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;300g of whipping cream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;35g of caster sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30ml of whiskey, (smoky Islay such as Caol Ila or Ardbeg is best)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;80g of porridge oats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200g of raspberries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 tablespoons of tablespoons honey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;icing sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make the honeyed oats; toast the oats in a dry pan until lightly coloured. Add 2 tablespoons of the honey and a pinch of sea salt, stir until reduced and the oats forms clusters. Transfer to a tray and leave to cool.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take half of the raspberries and place in a pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons of honey. Stir over a high heat to make a sort of compot. Bring to the boil then remove and allow to cool.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Place the sugar, cream and whisky in a bowl and whisk until soft peaks form. Mix in the whole raspberries, saving a few back for garnish, about half of the raspberry compote, and most of the honeyed oats, saving some for garnish. Fold everything together to create a marble effect, then serve into bowls, finishing with the whole raspberries, honeyed oats and compote. Finally dust a little icing sugar over the top.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Stuffed Saddle of Lamb</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/grubdaily/stuffed_saddle_of_lamb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lamb chops were always a staple part of our diet when we were young, usually simply roasted and served with baked potatoes and veg from the garden; simple but delicious. The loin meat from the top half of the saddle - the best end - is some of nicest and most tender from the whole animal. Keep the chops attached and you have a rack of lamb, perfect to roast whole and carve into classic lamb cutlets. The bottom half of the saddle - the short saddle - does not have any rib bones and so you would normally just roast this as a piece of loin. What we do in the restaurant is a little more special however; we take the loin from the bone, leaving a flap of the belly fat attached, then make a stuffing from sauteed kidneys and spinach and roll the loin up inside the fat. The saddle is then tied with string and roasted. It’s a lovely way to cook the loin meat as it’s quite well protected from the surrounding fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 short saddle of lamb, belly flaps attached&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 lamb kidneys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200g of baby spinach&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 pitted black olives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 shallot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 small clove of clove of garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 green courgettes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 yellow courgettes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extra virgin olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vegetable oil, for frying&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sea salt and cracked black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Carefully remove the bone from the short saddle, being careful not to leave any of the meat attached to the bone. Trim off the skin from the layer of fat, being very careful not to make any holes in the flap, as we need this intact in order to wrap around the loins. You now have 2 pieces of loin with a flap of fat attached to each. Place the layer of fat on a chopping board and bash it out with the flat part of a heavy knife, to flatten the fat to a nice thin layer. Again, be careful not to make any holes. Place the loins in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get a medium pan hot on the stove, and sautee the spinach with a pinch of salt until gently wilted. Transfer to a colander and leave to chill in the fridge. Meanwhile, finely chop the shallot and garlic and sweat slowly in olive oil until soft. Transfer to a bowl. Roughly chop the black olive and add to the bowl. Now take the lamb kidneys and remove the outer membrane. Cut in half lengthways and cut out the white gristle from inside. Cut the kidneys into 5mm dice, then fry in a hot pan until lightly coloured. Remove, and add to the bowl with the shallots, garlic and olive. Once the spinach is cold, squeeze all the remaining moisture from it by wringing in your hands. Mix together with the kidney and shallot mixture. Season to taste with salt and cracked black pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Divide the mix into two, one half for each loin. Lay out the loin on a board with the fat facing towards you. Place the spinach mix tight into the join of where the loin meets the fat, then roll it up, with the fat wrapping around the loin. Tie securely with butcher’s twine. Repeat with the other loin. Place the stuffed saddles in the fridge for 30 minutes to set.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heat the oven to 180C. Cut 2mm slices off the courgettes lengthways, taking only the vibrant skin from the outside, and reserve the inner white part for another recipe. Cut the slices into thin strips. Set aside. Get a heavy based frying pan hot on the stove, and fry the stuffed saddles until lightly coloured all over. Place in the oven for 3 minutes, then turn over. Return to the oven for 5 minutes, or until the inside temperature reaches 55C, which is medium rare. Leave the meat to rest on a rack for 15-20 minutes. Just before carving the meat, saute the courgettes in olive oil until just cooked, and season with sea salt. Carve each loin into 3 pieces, and place on top of the spaghetti of courgettes. Serve with some nice crusty bread and a glass of white wine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

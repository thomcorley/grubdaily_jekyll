I use beurre manié a lot for thickening sauces and gravy; it&#8217;s a great method of doing this as it thickens as well as adding a glossy sheen. I make large batches at a time, then freeze in small pieces, so it can conveniently be added straight from the freezer.

### Beurre Manié Recipe

Simply blend equal quantities of unsalted butter and plain flour with a fork until completely smooth, then roll into a cylinder with cling film. Place in the fridge to set, then slice into small portions. These can then be put in the freezer for future use.
